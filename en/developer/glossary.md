external id

external identifier

external identifiers

    

string identifier stored in `ir.model.data`, can be used to refer to a record
regardless of its database identifier during data imports or export/import
roundtrips.

External identifiers are in the form `_module_._id_` (e.g.
`account.invoice_graph`). From within a module, the `_module_.` prefix can be
left out.

Sometimes referred to as “xml id” or `xml_id` as XML-based [Data
Files](reference/backend/data#reference-data) make extensive use of them.

format string

    

inspired by [jinja
variables](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#variables), format
strings allow more easily mixing literal content and computed content
(expressions): content between `{{` and `}}` is interpreted as an expression
and evaluated, other content is interpreted as literal strings and displayed
as-is

GIS

Geographic Information System

    

any computer system or subsystem to capture, store, manipulate, analyze,
manage or present spatial and geographical data.

minified

minification

    

process of removing extraneous/non-necessary sections of files (comments,
whitespace) and possibly recompiling them using equivalent but shorter
structures ([ternary operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:) instead of
`if/else`) in order to reduce network traffic
