# Changelog

## Odoo version 16.0

  * Translations for translated fields are stored as JSONB values with [#97692](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/97692) and [#101115](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/101115). Code translations are no longer stored into the database. They become static and are extracted from the PO files when needed.

  * `search_count()` takes the `limit` argument into account with [#95589](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/95589). It limits the number of records to count, improving performance when a partial result is acceptable.

## Odoo Online version 15.4

  * New API for flushing to the database and invalidating the cache with [#87527](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/87527). New methods have been added to `odoo.models.Model` and `odoo.api.Environment`, and are less confusing about what is actually done in each case. See the section [SQL Execution](../orm.html#reference-orm-sql).

## Odoo Online version 15.3

  * The argument `args` is renamed to `domain` for `search()`, `search_count()` and `_search()`. [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)

  * `filtered_domain()` conserves the order of the current recordset. [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)

  * `browse()` does not accept [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "\(in Python v3.12\)") as `ids`. [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)

  * The methods `fields_get_keys()` and `get_xml_id()` on `Model` are deprecated. [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)

  * The method `_mapped_cache()` is removed. [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)

  * Remove the `limit` attribute of `One2many` and `Many2many`. [#83687](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83687)

## Odoo Online version 15.2

  * Specific index types on fields: With [#83274](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83274) and [#83015](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83015), developers can now define what type of indexes can be used on fields by PostgreSQL. See the [index property](../orm.html#reference-fields) of `odoo.fields.Field`.

  * The `_sequence` attribute of `Model` is removed. Odoo lets PostgreSQL use the default sequence of the primary key. [#82727](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/82727)

  * The method `_write()` does not raise an error for non-existing records. [#82727](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/82727)

  * The `column_format` and `deprecated` attributes of `Field` are removed. [#82727](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/82727)
