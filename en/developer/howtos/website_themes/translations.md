# Translations

With Odoo, you can translate your website into different languages.

In this chapter, you will learn how to:

  * Translate the content of a module.

  * Import and export translations.

  * Integrate translations to a module.

## Frontend

To translate your pages with the Website Builder, go to your website and click
on the language selector to switch to it. If your website was never translated
to the target language, click Add a language…, select it in the pop-up window,
and click Add.

Click Translate to start translating. Depending on the language, some text is
automatically translated and highlighted in green, while everything that
should be translated manually is highlighted in yellow.

## Backend

Translating pages directly from the backend allows you to translate several
languages at the same time. To do so, go to Settings ‣ Technical ‣ User
Interface: Views, search for the name of the page you want to translate, and
click the Edit Translations button.

## Export

Once you are done translating, you need to export the translations to
integrate them into your module. To export everything at once, open your
database, activate [developer
mode](../../../applications/general/developer_mode.html#developer-mode), and
go to Settings ‣ Translations ‣ Export Translation. Select the Language you
translated, _PO File_ under File Format, and _website_airproof_ as the Apps To
Export.

Download the file and move it to the `i18n` folder. If needed, you can
manually edit the `.po` file afterward.

## PO file

You can translate directly by editing a `.po` file or creating the file
yourself. Check out the [translating modules
documentation](../translations.html) to write your translations.

`/website_coconuts/i18n/fr_BE.po`

    
    
    #. module: website_airproof
    #: model_terms:ir.ui.view,arch_db:website_airproof.s_custom_snippet
    msgid "..."
    msgstr "..."
    

## Import

To import your translation files into Odoo, go to Settings ‣ Translations ‣
Import Translation and upload them.
