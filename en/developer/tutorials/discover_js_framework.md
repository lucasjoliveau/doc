# Discover the JS Framework

  * [Chapter 1: Owl Components](discover_js_framework/01_owl_components.html)
  * [Chapter 2: Odoo Web Framework](discover_js_framework/02_web_framework.html)

This tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of the Odoo
Javascript framework. Whether you are new to the framework or have some prior
experience, this tutorial will provide you with a solid foundation for using
the Odoo JavaScript framework in your projects.

This tutorial is divided into two parts. The first part covers the basics of
Owl components, which are a key part of the Odoo JS framework. Owl components
are reusable UI components that can be used to build complex web interfaces
quickly and efficiently. We will explore how to create and use Owl components
in Odoo.

The second part of the tutorial focuses on creating a dashboard using various
features of Odoo. Dashboards are an essential part of any web application, and
provide a nice starting point to use and interact with the Odoo codebase.

This tutorial assumes that you have some basic knowledge of development with
Odoo in general (models, controllers, QWeb, â€¦). If you are new to Odoo, we
recommend that you start with the [Getting started](getting_started.html)
tutorial before proceeding with this one.

## Setup

  1. Clone the [official Odoo tutorials repository](https://github.com/odoo/tutorials) and switch to the branch `16.0`.

  2. Add the cloned repository to the [`--addons-path`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-odoo-bin-addons-path).

  3. Start a new Odoo database and install the modules `owl_playground` and `awesome_tshirt`.
