This tutorial is designed for those who have completed the [Discover the JS
Framework](discover_js_framework) tutorial and are looking to deepen
their knowledge of the Konvergo ERP web framework.

For this training, we will step into the shoes of the IT staff at the
fictional company Awesome T-Shirt, which is dedicated to printing custom
t-shirts for online customers. The Awesome T-Shirt company uses Konvergo ERP to manage
orders and has created a dedicated Konvergo ERP module to manage their workflow.

In this tutorial, we will explore various aspects of the Konvergo ERP web framework in
detail, including fields and views, notifications, command palette, and much
more. This tutorial will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to
take full advantage of the Konvergo ERP web framework. So, letâ€™s get started!
