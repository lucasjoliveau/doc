# Live Chat

Konvergo ERP _Live Chat_ allows users to communicate with website visitors in real
time. With _Live Chat_ , leads can be qualified for their sales potential,
support questions can be answered quickly, and issues can be directed to the
appropriate team for further investigation (or follow up). _Live Chat_ also
provides the opportunity for instant feedback from customers.

## Enable Live Chat

In order to enable _Live Chat_ , the _Live Chat_ application needs to be
installed. This can be done in one of two ways.

  * Go to Apps ‚Ä£ Live Chat and click **Install**.

  * In the Website application, go to Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings, scroll to the **Email & Marketing** section, check the box next to **Livechat** , and click **Save**.

![View of the settings page and the live chat feature for Konvergo ERP Live
Chat.](../../_images/enable-setting.png)

After the **Live Chat** application is installed, a live chat **Channel** will
be created by default and automatically selected in the drop-down.

## Create a new live chat channel

To create a new live chat _Channel_ , go to Main Konvergo ERP Dashboard ‚Ä£ Live Chat
app ‚Ä£ New. This will open a blank channel detail form. Enter the name of the
new channel in the **Channel Name** field.

![View of a live chat channel form for Konvergo ERP Live Chat.](../../_images/open-
channel.png)

To configure the remaining tabs on the channel detail form (**Operators** ,
**Options** , **Channel Rules** , and **Widgets**), follow the steps below.

### Operators

_Operators_ are the users who will respond to live chat requests from
customers. When a user is added as an operator in a live chat channel, they
will be able to receive chats from website visitors wherever they are in the
database. Chat windows will open in the bottom right corner of the screen.

![View of a live chat pop up window in an Konvergo ERP database.](../../_images/pop-
up1.png)

The user who originally created the live chat channel will be added as an
operator by default.

To add additional users, navigate back to the **Website Live Chat Channels**
dashboard via the breadcrumbs and click on the appropriate **Live Chat
Channel**. Then, on the channel detail form, under the **Operators** tab,
click **ADD** to reveal an **Add: Operators** pop-up window.

In the pop-up window, search for the desired user(s). Then, click the checkbox
next to the user(s) to be added, and click **SELECT**.

New operators can be created and added to the list directly from this pop-up,
as well, by clicking **New** , and filling out the **Create Operators** pop-up
form. When the form is complete, click **SAVE & CLOSE** (or **SAVE & NEW** for
multiple record creations).

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Current operators can be edited (or removed) by clicking on their respective boxes in the
<b>Operators</b> tab, which reveals a separate <b>Open: Operators</b> pop-up. In that
pop-up, adjust any information as needed, and click <b>Save</b>, or click <b>Remove</b>
to remove that operator from the channel.</p>
</div>

### Options

The **Options** tab on the live chat channel details form contains the visual
and text settings for the live chat window.

#### Livechat button

The _Livechat Button_ is the icon that appears in the bottom corner of the
website.

![View of an Konvergo ERP website emphasizing the livechat
button.](../../_images/chat-button.png)

Change the text in the **Text of the Button** field to update the greeting
displayed in the text bubble when the live chat button appears on the website.

Change the **Livechat Button Color** by clicking a color bubble to open the
color selection window. Click the **üîÑ (refresh)** icon to the right of the
color bubbles to reset the colors to the default selection.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Color selection, for the button or header, can be made manually using a slider or through RGB,
HSL, or HEX color code entries from the pop-up color selection window that appears when either of
the color bubbles are clicked. Different options will be available, depending on your operating
system.</p>
</div>

#### Livechat window

The _Livechat Window_ is the space where the live chat conversation with
website visitors takes place.

Edit the **Welcome Message** to change the message a visitor sees when they
open a new chat session. This message will appear as though it is sent by a
live chat operator, and acts as both a greeting and an invitation to continue
the conversation.

Edit the **Chat Input Placeholder** to alter the text that appears in the box
where visitors will type their replies.

The _Channel Header_ is the colored bar at the top of the chat window. The
**Channel Header Color** can be changed following the same steps as the
_Livechat Button Color_ above.

![../../_images/chat-window.png](../../_images/chat-window.png)

### Channel rules

The **Channel Rules** tab on the live chat channel details form determines
when the _Live Chat Window_ opens on the website, by configuring when a **URL
Regex** action is triggered (e.g., a page visit).

To create a new channel rule, click **Add a line**. This opens the **Open:
Rules** pop-up.

![View of a channel's rules form for Konvergo ERP Live Chat.](../../_images/create-
rules.png)

#### Create new rules

Fill out the fields on the **Open: Rules** pop-up as instructed below, then
click **Save**.

Live Chat ButtonChatbotURL RegexOpen automatically timerCountry

The _Livechat Button_ is the icon that appears in the bottom corner of the
website. Select from one of the following display options:

  * **Show** displays the chat button on the page(s).

  * **Show with notification** displays the chat button, as well as a floating text bubble next to the button.

  * **Open automatically** displays the button and automatically opens the chat window after a specified amount of time (designated in the **Open automatically timer** field).

  * **Hide** hides the chat button on the page(s).

If a _Chatbot_ will be included on this channel, select it from the dropdown.
If the chatbot will only be active when no operators are active, check the box
labeled **Enabled only if no operator**.

In the **URL Regex** field, input the relative URL of the page where the chat
button should appear.

This field designates the amount of time (in seconds) a page will be open
before the chat window will open. If the **Livechat Button** for this rule is
not set to **Open automatically** , this field will be ignored.

If this channel should only be available to site visitors in specific
countries, add them to the **Country** field. If this field is left blank, the
channel will be available to all site visitors, regardless of location.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>In order to track the geographical location of visitors, <b>GeoIP</b> must be installed on
the database. While this feature is installed by default on <em>Konvergo ERP Online</em>, <em>On-Premise</em> databases
will require additional <a href="../../administration/on_premise/geo_ip">setup steps</a>.</p>
</div>

### Widget

The **Widget** tab on the live chat channel details form provides the
shortcode for an embeddable website widget. This code can be added to a
website to provide access to a live chat window.

The live chat widget can be added to websites created through Konvergo ERP by
navigating to the Website ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings. Then scroll to the
**Livechat** section, and select the channel to add to the site. Click
**Save** to apply.

To add the widget to a website created on a third-party platform, click the
first **COPY** button on the **Widget** tab and paste the code into the
`<head>` tag on the site.

Likewise, to send a live chat session to a customer, click the second **COPY**
button on the **Widget** tab. This link can be sent directly to a customer,
and once they click the link, it will open a new chat.

## Participate in a conversation

As explained above, _operators_ are the users who will respond to live chat
requests from customers. The information below outlines the necessary steps
for operators participating in live chat conversations on an Konvergo ERP database.

### Set an online chat name

Before participating in a live chat, operators should update their _Online
Chat Name_. This is the name that will be displayed to site visitors in the
live chat conversation.

To update the **Online Chat Name** , click on the user name in the upper-right
corner of any page in the database. Select **My Profile** to open the Profile
page. On the right side of the **Preferences** tab, locate the **Online Chat
Name** field and enter the preferred name.

![View of the My Profile option in Konvergo ERP.](../../_images/my-profile.png)

If a users **Online Chat Name** is not set, the name displayed will default to
the **User Name**.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>A user has their full name as their <b>User Name</b>, but they do not want to include their
last name in a live chat conversation. They would then set their <b>Online Chat Name</b> to
include only their first name.</p>
<img alt="View of user profile in Konvergo ERP, emphasizing the Online Chat name field." class="align-center" src="../../_images/online-chat-name.png"/>
</div>

### Join or leave a channel

To join a live chat channel, go to the Live Chat app and click the **JOIN**
button on the kanban card for the appropriate channel.

Any channel where the user is currently active will show a **LEAVE** button.
Click this button to disconnect from the channel.

![View of a channel form and the option to join a channel for Konvergo ERP Live
Chat.](../../_images/leave-channel.png) <div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p><em>Operators</em> that do not show any activity in Konvergo ERP for more than thirty minutes will be considered
disconnected, and subsequently removed from the channel.</p>
</div>

### Manage live chat requests

When an operator is active in a channel, chat windows will open in the bottom
right corner of the screen, no matter where they are in the database. They can
participate in conversations without leaving their current location.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Conversations can also be accessed by clicking the <b>Conversations</b> icon in the
menu bar.</p>
<img alt="View of the menu bar in Konvergo ERP emphasizing the conversations icon." class="align-center" src="../../_images/menu-bar.png"/>
</div>

Live chat conversations can also be viewed by navigating to Dashboard ‚Ä£
Discuss. New conversations will appear in bold under the **LIVECHAT** heading
along the left panel.

![View of the discuss application with a message sent through live chat in
Konvergo ERP.](../../_images/managing-chat-responses.png)

Click on a conversation in the left panel to select it. This will open the
conversation. From this view, an operator can participate in the chat the same
as they would in the normal chat window.
