# Chatbots

A _Chatbot_ is a program designed to mimic a conversation with a live human.
Chatbots are assigned a script of pre-written steps to follow. The scripts are
designed to anticipate a visitor’s potential response, and lead them through a
series of questions and answers the same way a live team member would.

Chatbots can be customized to fill various roles, from customer support, to
creating leads, to collecting contact information. The goal of the chatbot
depends on the page of the website they are assigned, and the messages
included in the script, among other criteria.

## Build a chatbot

Before creating a new chatbot, the _Live Chat_ application must first be
installed on the database. This can be done directly from the Apps menu by
searching for `Live Chat` in the **search bar** and clicking **Install**.

Alternatively, _Live Chat_ can be installed and enabled by navigating to the
Website application ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, and checking the box labeled
**Livechat**. Once enabled, the database will refresh, and the _Live Chat_
application is accessible.

Once the _Live Chat_ application has been installed on the database, open it,
and go to Configuration ‣ Chatbots.

<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>When the <em>Live Chat</em> app is installed, a sample chatbot is created, named <em>Welcome Bot</em>. This
chatbot has a pre-configured script that walks through a few basic steps, including asking for a
visitor’s email address, and forwarding the conversation to an operator.</p>
<p><em>Welcome Bot</em> can be used as a starting point. The existing steps can be edited or removed, and
new steps can be added to customize the script, as needed.</p>
<p><em>Welcome Bot</em> can be deleted (or archived).</p>
<img alt="View of the Welcome Bot script in Konvergo ERP Live Chat." class="align-center" src="../../../_images/chatbot-welcome-bot.png"/>
</div>

To create a new chatbot, navigate to the **Chatbot** page (Live Chat app ‣
Configuration ‣ Chatbots) and click **New**. This opens a blank chatbot
details page.

On the blank chatbot details page, enter a name in the **Chatbot Name** field
and click on the **Edit Image** icon in the upper right corner of the form to
add a photo.

### Chatbot scripts

Once the new chatbot has been created and named, the next step is to create a
script. Chatbot conversations follow an accompanying script. These scripts are
comprised of lines of dialogue, each designed to either deliver or capture
information.

To create a chatbot script, navigate to the **Script** tab of the chatbot
details page, and click **Add a Line** to open the **Create Script Steps**
pop-up form.

This form must be filled out for each line of text (dialogue) that the chatbot
could potentially deliver during the conversation.

First, enter the content of the message in the **Message** field. Then, select
an option from the **Step Types** drop-down menu.

#### Step types

The **Step Type** selected depends on the intended purpose of the message. The
available options in the **Step Type** drop-down are listed below, as well as
their use, and any additional information:

##### Text

This step is used for messages where no answer is expected (or necessary).
Text steps can be used for greetings and/or to deliver information.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>Text step types are only intended to deliver information, and do not allow for any visitor input.
As such, they need to be followed by additional steps to continue the conversation.</p>
</div>

##### Question

This step asks a question and provides a set of answers. The visitor clicks on
one answer, which either leads to a new step in the conversation, or can lead
to an optional link to a new webpage.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>It is helpful to add a catchall answer to question steps (ex: “Something else”). This helps
visitors continue the conversation, even if their needs don’t exactly fit with any of the other
answers.</p>
</div>

##### Email

This step prompts visitors to provide their email address, which is stored and
can be used by team members later to follow up with additional information.

The only accepted inputs for this step type are email addresses that are in a
valid format. If a visitor attempts to enter anything other than a valid email
address, the chatbot responds with a message stating it does not recognize the
information submitted.

![View of a chatbot responding to an invalid email.](../../../_images/chatbot-
invalid-email.png)

##### Phone

Similar to email, this step type prompts the visitor to enter their phone
number, which can be used at a later time to follow up with additional
information, or to schedule demos, and more.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>Due to the vast number of formats used for phone numbers worldwide, responses to this step type
are <b>not</b> validated for formatting.</p>
</div>

##### Forward to Operator

This step forwards the conversation to an active live chat operator, so that
they can continue assisting the visitor. As the conversation transcript is
passed on to the operator they are able to pick up where the chatbot left off.
This not only saves time for all parties involved, it can also help qualify
conversations before they reach live human operators.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>If no active operator is available on the channel, the chatbot continues the conversation with
the visitor. Therefore, additional steps should be added after this one to ensure that there is
no abrupt end to the conversation.</p>
<img alt="View of a chatbot follow up messages when no live chat operator is available." class="align-center" src="../../../_images/chatbot-no-operator.png"/>
</div>

##### Free Input/Multi-Line

The free input step allows visitors to respond to questions without providing
pre-written responses. Information provided in these responses is stored in
the chat transcripts.

Choose between **Free Input** and **Free Input (Multi-Line)** depending on the
type and amount of information being requested from the visitor.

##### Create Lead

This step creates a lead in the _CRM_ application. Select an option from the
**Sales Team** drop-down to assign the created lead to a specific team.

##### Create Ticket

This step creates a
[ticket](../../services/helpdesk/overview/receiving_tickets) in the
_Helpdesk_ application. Select an option from the **Helpdesk Team** drop-down
to assign the created ticket to a specific team.

#### Only if

Chatbot scripts operate on an if/then basis, which means the next question
presented to the visitor is determined by the answer they provide to the
previous question.

To continue the progression of the conversation, the form for a new step
contains a field labeled **Only If**. This field is where the progression of
questions is defined.

If a step is intended to follow all of the previous messages, this field can
be left empty. However, if a message should **only** be sent conditionally,
based on a previous response (or several previous responses), those responses
need to be added to this field.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>If there are any selections made in the <b>Only If</b> field, the step will <b>not</b> be shown
in a conversation unless <b>all</b> of the answers have been selected. Only include selections in
this field if they are necessary for this step to be displayed.</p>
</div> <div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>In the <em>Welcome Bot</em> script, a visitor can ask about pricing information. If the visitor selects
this response, a step is included to forward the conversation to an operator. The chatbot first
sends a message informing the visitor that it is checking to see if an operator is available to
chat.</p>
<p>However, this message should <b>only</b> be delivered if the visitor requests pricing information.
In that situation, the conversation would proceed as below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Welcome Bot: “<em>What are you looking for?</em>”</p></li>
<li><p>Visitor: “<b>I have a pricing question.</b>”</p></li>
<li><p>Welcome Bot: “<em>Hmmm, let me check if I can find someone that could help you with that…</em>”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the details form for the <b>Text</b> step, the <em>I have a pricing question</em> response has
been selected in the <b>Only If</b> field. As such, this step is <b>only</b> shown in
conversations where that response has been selected.</p>
<img alt="View of the new message form emphasizing the Only If field." class="align-center" src="../../../_images/chatbot-only-if.png"/>
</div>

### Script testing

In order to ensure all visitors have a satisfactory experience with the
chatbot, each message needs to lead to a natural conclusion. Chatbot scripts
should be tested to confirm there are no dead-ends, and to get an
understanding of what the visitor sees when they interact with the chatbot.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>If there is an answer or input provided by the visitor that is <b>not</b> assigned a corresponding
follow-up response, the conversation stops (<em>dead-end</em>). Since the visitor cannot re-engage the
chatbot, they will have to re-start the conversation, by refreshing the chat window, or their
browser.</p>
</div>

To test the performance of a chatbot, first click on the **Test** button at
the top-left of the chatbot script page. Then, upon being redirected to the
testing screen, answer the chatbot prompts the same way a potential site
visitor would.

When the script has reached an end-point, the message _Conversation
ended…Restart_ appears at the bottom of the chat window. To begin the
conversation at the beginning of the script, click on **Restart**. To return
to the script page, click **Back to edit mode** at the top of the page.

## Add chatbot to a channel

After a chatbot has been created and tested, it needs to be added to a live
chat channel.

First, open the Live Chat application, and select the kanban card for a
**Channel** , or create a [new one](../livechat). Click on the **Channel
Rules** tab. Then, open an existing rule, or create a new one by clicking
**Add a line**.

On the **Create Rules** pop-up detail form, choose the appropriate chatbot in
the **Chatbot** field.

If the chatbot should **only** be active if there are no available live chat
operators, check the box labeled **Enabled only if no operator**.
