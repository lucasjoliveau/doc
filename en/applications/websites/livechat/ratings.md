# Ratings

At the end of a _Live Chat_ conversation, customers have the opportunity to
rate the quality of support they received from the live chat _operator_.
Customers provide ratings as soon as they close the conversation. This allows
operators to receive immediate feedback on their performance. It also allows
customers the chance to share any final comments before leaving the chat
window.

## Rate live chat conversations

Customers end a _live chat_ conversation by clicking the **X** in the upper
right-hand corner of the chat window. They are then prompted to select an icon
that reflects their level of satisfaction. The icons represent the following
ratings:

>   * **Satisfied** \- _green smiling face_
>
>   * **Okay** \- _yellow neutral face_
>
>   * **Dissatisfied** \- _red frowning face_
>
>

Note</p><p>When customers end a conversation, a field marked <b>Receive a copy of this conversation</b>
appears under the <em>ratings</em> icons. Customers can enter their email either before or after they
submit a rating.</p>

If the customer selects **Satisfied (smile)** icon, they are presented with a
thank you message and a **Close Conversation** link.

If the customer selects either **Okay (neutral)** icon or **Dissatisfied
(frown)** icon, a text box will appear. Customers can add comments in this
text box to explain why they chose this rating. This message will be sent to
the live chat operator, along with the rating icon.

for that team. Then click on the **Go to Website** smart button. This will

Note</p><p>The customer notes that are submitted with the rating will <em>not</em> be published on the website.
These are kept internal. Only a statistical overview of the operators’ performance for the
<em>channel</em> appears on the website.</p>
</div>

### Add ratings page to site

Once the rating page has been published, it has to be manually added to the
website. To do this, go to the main Konvergo ERP dashboard and open the _Website_
application. Website app‣ Site ‣ Content ‣ Pages, then click **New**.

This will open a **New Page** pop-up window. In the **Page Title** field,
enter `livechat`. This acts as the URL for the published webpage.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>The URL <em>must</em> be named <code>livechat</code> in order for the database to recognize and connect the
ratings page. After the page has been published, the page title can be changed later under the
<b>Menu Editor</b>.</p>
</div>

Click **Create** , and the newly created webpage will open. The **Webpage
Editor** appears in the right panel.

The page lists the names of the **Live Chat Channels** whose ratings pages
have been published. On the left side of the channel name is a speech bubble
icon, which users can click on to go to the ratings’ page for the respective
channel.

Make any desired changes or additions to this page, then click **Save** in the
top right of the webpage editor. The website editor side panel closes, and the
webpage remains on the screen.

To publish the `livechat` webpage, return to the list of webpages by
navigating to Site ‣ Content ‣ Pages. Click the checkbox to the left of
`livechat` in the list of pages to select the page and highlight the line.
Then, click the checkbox under the column labeled **Is Published**. The field
with the checkbox is highlighted in white. Click the checkbox a second time to
activate the **Is Published** box. The webpage is now published.

Once the page has been added to the site, ratings are set to be published by
default. However, individual ratings can be manually selected to be hidden
from the public. The rating will still be included in internal reports, and
can still be viewed by internal teams. However, public website visitors and
portal users will not have access.

## Customer ratings report

The **Customer Ratings** report (Live Chat ‣ Report ‣ Customer Ratings)
displays an overview of the ratings received on individual support tickets, as
well as any additional comments submitted with the rating.
