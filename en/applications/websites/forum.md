# Forum

**Odoo Forum** is a question-and-answer forum designed with providing customer
support in mind. Adding a forum to a website enables you to build a community,
encourage engagement, and share knowledge.

## Create a forum

To create or edit a forum, go to Website â€£ Configuration â€£ Forum: Forums.
Click New or select an existing forum and configure the following elements.

Forum Name: add the name of the forum.

Mode: select Questions to enable marking an answer as best, meaning questions
then appear as _solved_ , or Discussions if the feature is not needed.

Note

Regardless of the selected mode, only **one answer** per user is allowed on a
single post. Commenting multiple times is allowed, however.

Default Sort: choose how questions are sorted by default.

>   * Newest: by latest question posting date
>
>   * Last Updated: by latest posting activity date (answers and comments
> included)
>
>   * Most Voted: by highest vote tally
>
>   * Relevance: by post relevancy (determined by a formula)
>
>   * Answered: by likelihood to be answered (determined by a formula)
>
>

Note

Users have several sorting options (total replies, total views, last activity)
on the forum front end.

Privacy: select Public to let anyone view the forum, Signed In to make it
visible only for signed-in users, or Some users to make it visible only for a
specific user access group by selecting one Authorized Group.

Next, configure the karma gains and the karma-related rights.

### Karma points

Karma points can be given to users based on different forum interactions. They
can be used to determine which forum functionalities users can access, from
being able to vote on posts to having moderator rights. They are also used to
set user ranks.

Important

  * A userâ€™s karma points are shared across all forums, courses, etc., of a single Odoo website.

  * eLearning users can earn karma points through different [course interactions](elearning.html#elearning-karma) and by [completing quizzes](elearning.html#elearning-quiz).

#### Karma gains

Several forum interactions can give or remove karma points.

Interaction | Description | Default karma gain  
---|---|---  
Asking a question | You post a question. | 2  
Question upvoted | Another user votes for a question you posted. | 5  
Question downvoted | Another user votes against a question you posted. | -2  
Answer upvoted | Another user votes for an answer you posted. | 10  
Answer downvoted | Another user votes against an answer you posted. | -2  
Accepting an answer | You mark an answer posted by another user as best. | 2  
Answer accepted | Another user marks an answer you posted as best. | 15  
Answer flagged | A question or an answer you posted is marked as offensive. | -100  
  
Note

New users receive **three points** upon validating their email address.

To modify the default values, go to Website â€£ Configuration â€£ Forum: Forums,
select the forum, and go to the Karma Gains tab. Select a value to edit it.

If the value is positive (e.g., `5`), the number of points will be added to
the userâ€™s tally each time the interaction happens on the selected forum.
Conversely, if the value is negative (e.g., `-5`), the number of points will
be deducted. Use `0` if an interaction should not impact a userâ€™s tally.

#### Karma-related rights

To configure how many karma points are required to access the different forum
functionalities, go to Website â€£ Configuration â€£ Forum: Forums, select the
forum, and go to the Karma Related Rights tab. Select a value to edit it.

Tip

Track all karma-related activity and add or remove karma manually by [enabling
developer mode](../general/developer_mode.html#developer-mode) and going to
Settings â€£ Gamification Tools â€£ Karma Tracking.

### Gamification

Ranks and badges can be used to encourage participation. Ranks are based on
the total karma points, while badges can be granted manually or automatically
by completing challenges.

#### Ranks

To create new ranks or modify the default ones, go to Website â€£ Configuration
â€£ Forum: Ranks and click New or select an existing rank.

Add the Rank Name, the Required Karma points to reach it, its Description, a
Motivational message to encourage users to reach it, and an image.

![Default forum ranks](../../_images/ranks.png)

#### Badges

To create new badges or modify the default ones, go to Website â€£ Configuration
â€£ Forum: Badges and click New or select an existing badge.

Enter the badge name and description, add an image, and configure it.

##### Assign manually

If the badge should be granted manually, select which users can grant them by
selecting one of the following Allowance to Grant options:

  * Everyone: all non-portal users (since badges are granted from the backend).

  * A selected list of users: users selected under Authorized Users.

  * People having some badges: users who have been granted the badges selected under Required Badges.

It is possible to restrict how many times per month each user can grant the
badge by enabling Monthly Limited Sending and entering a Limitation Number.

##### Assign automatically

If the badge should be granted **automatically** when certain conditions are
met, select No one, assigned through challenges under Allowance to Grant.

Next, determine how the badge should be granted by clicking Add under the
Rewards for challenges section. Select a challenge to add it or create one by
clicking New.

Tip

It is possible to give the badge a Forum Badge Level (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to
give it more or less importance.

To Validate: access all questions and answers waiting for validation before
being displayed to non-moderator users.
