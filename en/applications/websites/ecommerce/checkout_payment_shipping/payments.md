## Configuration

To set up payment providers on the eCommerce app, go to Website ‣
Configuration ‣ Payment Providers. From here, **Activate** the payment
providers you wish to have available on your shop, and configure them
according to your needs.

Alternatively, you can access **payment providers** via Website ‣
Configuration ‣ Settings. In the **Shop - Payment** section, you can
**Configure SEPA Direct Debit** if you wish to use it, as well as **View other
providers**. If you use the **Authorize.net** payment provider, the [Payment
Capture Method](../../../finance/payment_providers#payment-providers-
manual-capture) can be configured in that same menu.

If you are using [PayPal](../../../finance/payment_providers/paypal), you
can also enable and configure it here.

### Checkout payment options

Once activated, customers can choose the payment provider of their choice
during the **checkout process** , at the **Confirm Order** step.

## eWallets and gift cards

When checking out, customers can pay with an eWallet or gift cards. To enable
these, go to Website ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, and in the **Shop-Products**
section, enable Discounts, Loyalty & Gift Card.

Once enabled, customers can enter their gift card **code** or pay with their
eWallet at the checkout step.
