## Configuration

To set up payment providers on the eCommerce app, go to Website ‣
Configuration ‣ Payment Providers. From here, Activate the payment providers
you wish to have available on your shop, and configure them according to your
needs.

Alternatively, you can access **payment providers** via Website ‣
Configuration ‣ Settings. In the Shop - Payment section, you can Configure
SEPA Direct Debit if you wish to use it, as well as View other providers. If
you use the Authorize.net payment provider, the [Payment Capture
Method](../../../finance/payment_providers.html#payment-providers-manual-
capture) can be configured in that same menu.

If you are using [PayPal](../../../finance/payment_providers/paypal.html), you
can also enable and configure it here.

### Checkout payment options

Once activated, customers can choose the payment provider of their choice
during the **checkout process** , at the Confirm Order step.
