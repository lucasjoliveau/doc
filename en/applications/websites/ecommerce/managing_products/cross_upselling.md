# Cross-selling and upselling

Any sales process is an opportunity to maximize revenues. **Cross-selling and
upselling** are sales techniques consisting in selling customers additional or
more expensive products and services than what they were originally shopping
for. It is a great way to maximize the value of each one of your customers.

**Cross-selling** can be done via **two** features:

  * Optional products upon **adding to cart** ;

  * Accessory products on the **checkout page**.

**Upselling** is only done via alternative products on the **product page**.
