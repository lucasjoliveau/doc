# Customer accounts

Having customer accounts on an eCommerce allows customers to access all their
documents from a single place. To access their account, customers must be
**logged-in** on the eCommerce website, click on their **username** in the
top-right corner of the screen, and click My Account. From there, customers
can access their quotations, orders, invoices, etc.

Note

Customers can only have an account if the [sign in/up at
checkout](../checkout_payment_shipping/checkout.html#checkout-sign) option
allows for accounts creation.

Tip

Similarly to the rest of the website, the customer account page can be
customized with **content blocks** and other features through the **website
builder**.

## Access restriction

It is possible to allow or restrict the documents to which customers have
access through the website builder. Log in your **own** account with your Odoo
database credentials, and go to Edit ‣ Customize. From the website builder
menu, enable or disable the documents customers can have access to.

## Multi-website account

If you own multiple websites, you can make customer accounts available across
**all** websites. Then, the customer only needs one account. To do so, go to
Website ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Privacy section, and enable Shared
Customer Accounts.
