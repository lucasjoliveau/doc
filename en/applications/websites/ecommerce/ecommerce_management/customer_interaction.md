# Customer interaction

Konvergo ERP offers many ways to interact with customers and for customers to interact
with your website.

## Product reviews

Customers can give a rating to your products. This is a great way to promote
your products or services since reviews can influence purchase processes. To
activate the **rating** feature, from your **shop page** , select a product,
go to Edit ‣ Customize and enable **Rating**.

<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Only portal users which purchased the product or service can leave ratings.</p>
</div> <div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Customer reviews can be hidden by clicking the <b>Visible</b> button next to a published
review.</p>
</div>

## Live chat

A chatbot is available and can simulate a human-like conversation with website
visitors via text messages in a chat box.

## Contact forms

### Helpdesk

Customers may need support after purchasing a product or subscribing to a
service. It is possible to create a **contact form** , which, when fulfilled,
automatically creates a new ticket for your **support team**.

![Contact form to submit a ticket to the support
team](../../../../_images/interaction-form.png)

To add a contact form, **create** a new page (\+ New ‣ Page) if necessary, and
drag and drop a **Form** block from the **Dynamic Content** section onto the
page. Once placed, click on the form (while in **Edit** mode), and in the
**Action** field, select **Create a Ticket**. You can then select to which
**Helpdesk team** the ticket should be assigned.

### Contact us

A ‘Contact Us’ page makes it easier for customers and prospects to contact
your company and get in touch.

To have a ‘Contact Us’ page, create a new page (\+ New ‣ Page) if necessary,
and click on Edit ‣ Customize. Then, drag and drop a **Form** block onto the
page. Select the form and define the action to be performed when submitted in
the **Action** field.

When clicking on a field, or when adding a new field (**\+ Field**), you can
select its **Type**. This enables different options, such as **Multiple
Checkboxes** , which customers can use to indicate the services they are
interested in, for example.

## Newsletter

Customers can get updates on your eCommerce activities by subscribing to a
newsletter. Visitors subscribing to the newsletter are automatically added to
the mailing list of the **Email Marketing** application. You can either choose
a newsletter **block** , a newsletter **popup** , or both.

  * **Popup** : prompts up a newsletter box when visitors scroll down the page;

  * **Block** : displays a field on the page where customers can sign up by entering their email.

The newsletter **block** can be configured according to different
**Templates**. To do so, click the **block** while in Edit ‣ Customize, and
select a **Template** in the **Newsletter Block** section. There are **three**
templates available:

  * **Email Subscription** : visitors can sign up by email to the newsletter, without any choice to the content. The content is defined in Edit ‣ Customize in the **Newsletter** field;

  * **SMS Subscription** : is the same as **Email Subscription** , but by SMS;

  * **Form Subscription** : allows adding several fields, as well as a checkbox for the visitor to agree to the **GDPR policy** of your website.

![Form subscription configuration and
settings](../../../../_images/interaction-news.png) <div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Alternatively, you can select <b>Subscribe to Newsletter</b> as <b>Action</b> when
creating a <a href="#contact-form"><span class="std std-ref">contact form</span></a>, allowing for the same level of customization. Make
sure to add a checkbox stating visitors agree to be added to the mailing list.</p>
