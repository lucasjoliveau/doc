# Translations

The contents of your website pages (i.e., text strings) can be translated into
different languages directly on your website.

Your website is displayed in the language that matches the visitor’s browser’s
language, unless that particular language has not been installed. In this
case, the website is displayed in the default language. The visitor can still
select another language in the language menu.

## Installing languages

To translate your website, you first have to add the required languages:

  1. Go to your website.

  2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **language menu**.

  3. Click the language and select **Add a language**.

  4. Click the **Languages** field and select the required language from the drop-down list. Repeat this step for each additional language.

  5. Click the **Add** button.

<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>You can also edit your website’s languages from the backend, in the <b>Settings</b>. Go to
Website –&gt; Configuration –&gt; Settings and add/remove the required languages in
the <b>Languages</b> field, in the <b>Website info</b> section.</p>
</div>

### Default language

If the language of the visitor’s browser is not installed on your website, the
content is displayed in the default language.

To define a default language, go to Website –> Configuration –> Settings, and
select a language in the **Default** field.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>This field is visible only if multiple languages are already configured for your website.</p>
</div>

## Translating the contents

Once the languages have been added, you can translate the contents of your
website. To do so, go to your website, select the language from the language
menu and click the **Translate** button on the right part of the task bar to
activate the **translation mode**.

As a result:

  * Text strings that have already been translated are highlighted in green;

  * Text strings that need to be translated are highlighted in yellow.

You can then replace the original text with the translation by clicking the
block, editing its contents and saving.

the product’s name and description) from the backend (e.g., in the product template). To do so,
click the language code (e.g., <b>EN</b>) next to the text you want to translate (e.g.,
the product name) and add the translation.</p>
