# Cookies bar

Cookies are small text files sent to your device when you visit a website.
They are processed and stored by your browser and contain information about
your visit, such as login data, location, language, etc. There are two main
types of cookies:

  * Essential cookies, which are necessary for the website to function properly;

  * Non-essential or optional cookies, which are used to analyze your behavior or display advertisements.

layout.](../../../../_images/popup.png)

Notifying users about data collection, as well as its methods and purposes, is
required by data protection laws such as [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu). Cookies bars
are commonly used to fulfill this obligation in a user-friendly and
transparent manner. They are displayed immediately upon a user’s first visit
to inform them that the website uses cookies and let them decide whether they
want to store non-essential cookies on their device.

## Configuration

To enable the cookies bar on your Konvergo ERP website, go to Website ‣ Configuration
and enable **Cookies Bar** in the **Privacy** section.

You can customize the appearance of your cookies bar and edit the content of
the related Cookie Policy page.

## Customization

To adapt the display of the cookies bar, click **Edit** and select the
**Cookies Bar** building block in the **Invisible Elements** at the bottom of
the panel. Customize it using the options in the **Customize** tab in the edit
panel. Three **Layouts** are available:

  * **Discrete** : thin bar

  * **Classic** : banner

  * **Popup** : you can change the popup’s **Position** to the **Top** , **Middle** , or **Bottom** of the screen.

You can also:

  * modify the **Size** of the cookies bar;

  * enable **Backdrop** to gray out the page in the background when the cookies bar is displayed on the screen;

  * further customize the appearance of the cookies bar using **Block** and/or **Column** customization options, which are available after clicking anywhere in the building block.

To edit the contents of the cookies bar (i.e., the consent message), click
directly in the building block.

## Cookie policy

When you enable the cookies bar for your website, Konvergo ERP creates the **Cookie
Policy** page (`/cookie-policy`) with the list of essential and optional
cookies. To access it, click the **Cookie Policy** hyperlink in the cookies
bar or open the page from Website ‣ Site ‣ Pages.

The contents of the page can be adapted based on your website’s features and
characteristics if needed.
