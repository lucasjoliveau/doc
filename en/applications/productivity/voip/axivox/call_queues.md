# Call queues

A call queue is a system that organizes and routes incoming calls. When
customers call a business, and all of the agents are busy, the call queue
lines up the callers in sequential order, based on the time they called in.

The callers then wait on hold to be connected to the next available call
center agent.

Implementing a call queue system reduces stress for employees, and helps build
brand trust with customers. Many companies use call queues to set expectations
with customers, and to distribute the workload equally amongst employees.

This document covers the process required to configure call queues (with
advanced settings), as well as how to log into a call queue from the Konvergo ERP
database.

## Add a queue

To add a call queue in Axivox, navigate to the [Axivox management
console](https://manage.axivox.com). In the left menu, click **Queues**. Next,
click **Add a queue**. Doing so reveals a blank **New queue** form with
various fields to fill out.

### Name

Once the **New queue** page appears, enter the **Name** of the queue.

### Internal extension

Choose an **Internal extension** for the queue. This is a number to be dialed
by users of the database to reach the login prompt for the queue.

### Strategy

Next, is the **Strategy** field. This field determines the call routing of
received calls into this queue.

The following choices are available in the **Strategy** drop-down menu:

  * **Call all available agents**

  * **Calls the agent who has received the call for the longest time**

  * **Calls the agent who has received the least call**

  * **Call a random agent**

  * **Call agents one after the other**

  * **Call agents one after the other starting with the first in the list**

Choose a strategy that best meets the company’s needs for customers in the
queue.

### Maximum waiting time in seconds

In the **Maximum waiting time in seconds** field, determine the longest time a
customer waits in the queue before going to a voicemail, or wherever else they
are directed to in a dial plan. Enter a time in seconds.

### Maximum duration of ringing at an agent

In the **Maximum duration of ringing at an agent** field, determine the
longest time an individual agent’s line rings before moving on to another
agent, or moving to the next step in the dial plan. Enter a time in seconds.

</ul>

### Adding agents

The final two fields on the **New queue** form revolve around adding agents.
Adding **Static agents** and **Dynamic agents** are two pre-configured methods
for adding agents onto the call queue during the configuration.

#### Static agents

When **Static agents** are added, these agents are automatically added to the
queue without the need to log in to receive calls.

#### Dynamic agents

When **Dynamic agents** are added, these agents have the ability to log into
this queue. They are **not** logged-in automatically, and **must** log in to
receive calls.

Be sure to **Save** the changes, and click **Apply changes** in the upper-
right corner to implement the change in production.

## Agent connection

There are three ways call agents can connect to an Axivox call queue:

  1. Dynamic agents connect automatically.

  2. Manager logs in specific agent(s), via the [Axivox management console](https://manage.axivox.com).

  3. Agent connects to the queue in Konvergo ERP, via the _VoIP_ widget.

console</a>.</p>
</div>

### Connect via Axivox queue

After the initial configuration of the call queue is completed, with the
changes saved and implemented, a manager can log into the [Axivox management
console](https://manage.axivox.com) and connect dynamic agents to the queue
manually.

To connect an agent, click **Queues** , located in the left-hand column. Doing
so reveals the **Queues** dashboard, with a few different columns listed:

  * **Name** : name of the queue.

  * **Extension** : number of the extension to be dialed to reach the queue.

  * **Agent Connection** : number to dial to log into the queue.

  * **Agent disconnection** : number to dial to log out of the queue.

  * **Connected Agents** : name of agent connected to the queue.

The following buttons are also available on the **Queues** dashboard:

  * **Connect an agent** : manually connect an agent to the queue.

  * **Report** : run a report on the queue.

  * **Delete** : delete the queue.

  * **Edit** : make changes to the settings of the queue.

When agents are connected to the queue, or are live with a customer, they are
displayed under the **Connected Agents** column.

If they are static agents, they **always** show up as connected.

Connect an agent by clicking the orange button labeled, **Connect an agent**.
Then, select the desired agent’s name from the drop-down menu, and click
**Connect**.

</ul>

#### Report

Click **Report** to check on the reporting for a particular queue, in order to
see who connected when, and what phone calls came in and out of the queue.
This information is showcased on a separate **Queue report** page, when the
green **Report** button is clicked.

Reports can be customized by date in the **Period** field, and specified in
the **From** and **to** fields. The information can be organized by **Event
type** , and **Call ID**.

When the custom configurations have been entered, click **Apply**.

Each report can be exported to a CSV file for further use and analysis, via
the **Export to CSV** button.

When the **Event type** field is clicked, a drop-down menu appears with the
following options:

  * **The caller quit**

  * **An agent is connecting**

  * **An agent is disconnecting**

  * **The call was terminated (agent hangs up)**

  * **The call was terminated (caller hangs up)**

  * **The caller is connected to an agent.**

  * **Someone is entering the queue**

  * **The caller exits the queue (no agent is connected)**

  * **The caller exits the queue (timeout)**

  * **No one is answering**

  * **No one is answering, the caller hangs up**

  * **Transfer**

  * **Blind Transfer**

![Event types in the Axivox queue reporting
feature.](../../../../_images/event-type.png)

There is no limit to how many options can be selected from the **Event type**
drop-down menu.

Clicking **Check all** selects all the available options from the drop-down
menu, and clicking **Uncheck all** removes all selections from the drop-down
menu.

To select an individual **Event type** , click on the desired option in the
drop-down menu.

### Connect to queue on Konvergo ERP

Dynamic agents can connect manually to the Axivox call queue from the Konvergo ERP
_VoIP_ widget, once the _VoIP_ app is configured for the individual user in
Konvergo ERP.

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<p class="alert-title">

</div>

To access the Konvergo ERP _VoIP_ widget, click the **☎️ (phone)** icon in the upper-
right corner of the screen, from any window within Konvergo ERP.

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<p class="alert-title">
See also</p><p>For more information on the Konvergo ERP <em>VoIP</em> widget, see this documentation: <a href="../voip_widget">VoIP widget</a></p>
</div>

For an agent to connect to the call queue, simply dial the **Agent
connection** number, and press the green call button **📞 (phone)** icon in the
_VoIP_ widget. Then, the agent hears a short, two-second message indicating
the agent is logged in. The call automatically ends (disconnects).

To view the connected agents in a call queue, navigate to the [Axivox
management console](https://manage.axivox.com), and click **Queues** , located
in the left-hand column.

Then, click the green **Refresh** button at the top of the **Connected
agents** column. Any agent (static or dynamic) that is connected to the queue
currently, appears in the column next to the queue they are logged into.

To log out of the queue, open the Konvergo ERP _VoIP_ widget, dial the **Agent
disconnection** number, and press the green call button **📞 (phone)** icon.
The agent is disconnected from the queue after a short, two-second message.

To manually log a dynamic agent out of a call queue, navigate to the [Axivox
management console](https://manage.axivox.com), and click **Queues** , located
in the left-hand column. Then, click the green **Refresh** button at the top
of the **Connected agents** column.

To disconnect an agent manually, click the red **Disconnect** button, and they
are immediately disconnected. This can be helpful in situations where agents
forget to log out at the end of the day.
