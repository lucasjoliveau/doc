# Make, receive, transfer, and forward calls

Calling prospective clients, customers, or colleagues is an essential part of
any business. A company also needs to be available when customers call, in
order to build trust and make connections.

This document covers how to make, receive, transfer, and forward calls with
Konvergo ERP _VoIP_.

## Make calls

Starting on the Konvergo ERP dashboard, a call can be made by opening the phone widget
in the the upper-right corner, which is represented by a **‚òéÔ∏è (phone)** icon.

Then, a user can click on the **Contacts** tab, and click into any contact in
the database to make a call.

Additionally, one can also use the **Search bar** in the **VOIP** pop-up
window to find any desired contact.

To manually make a call, click the **‚å®Ô∏è (keyboard)** icon, and proceed to
manually key in the desired number. Do not forget to lead with the **\+
(plus)** icon, followed by the international country code.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>For the United States of America, the country code and <b>+ (plus)</b> icon, would look like
this: <code>+1</code>. If one were to dial Belgium, the number would be prefixed by <code>+32</code>, and for Great
Britain it would be <code>+44</code>.</p>
</div>

After entering the full number, with the required **\+ (plus)** icon prefix
and country code, click the green **üìû (phone)** icon to start the call. When
finished, click the red **üìû (phone)** icon to end the call.

## Receive calls

An incoming call automatically opens the _VoIP_ widget, when a user is using
the Konvergo ERP database. Should the database be open in another tab, a sound plays
(the sound **must** be activated on the device).

Once back to the tab, the calling screen of the _VoIP_ phone widget appears.

Click the green **üìû (phone)** icon to pick up the call, or the red **üìû
(phone)** icon to reject the call.

## Add to call queue

All the contacts and customers that need to be called can be seen in one place
with the Konvergo ERP _VoIP_ phone widget, under the **Next activities** tab.

To add a call to the **Next activities** tab, click the green **üìû (phone)**
icon, while in kanban view of the _CRM_ application.

To remove them from the call queue, hover over the opportunity that has a call
scheduled, and click the red **üìû (phone)** icon that appears with the **\-
(minus)** icon.

When navigating back to the _VoIP_ phone widget, **only** the calls that are
scheduled immediately for that day appear in the queue under the **Next
Activities** tab of the _VoIP_ pop-up widget.

The **Next Activities** tab of the _VoIP_ phone widget is integrated with the
following Konvergo ERP apps: _CRM_ , _Project_ , and _Helpdesk_.

A call can be added in the chatter of records within those applications.

To manually add a call, via the chatter, click **Activities** (next to the **üïó
(clock)** icon). Under **Activity Type** , select **Call** from the drop-down
menu that appears.

Next, set a **Due Date** , and add a **Summary**.

Lastly, change the **Assigned to** field to the person that should make the
call. Whomever is set in this last field (**Assigned to**) has this call show
up in their **Next Activities** call queue in the Konvergo ERP _VoIP_ phone widget.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>Only calls for the immediate day (today‚Äôs date) appear in the <b>Next Activities</b> tab of
the <em>VoIP</em> phone widget for that specific user.</p>
</div>

If specified, click **Save** or **Open Calendar** to complete the scheduling
of the call.

## Transfer calls

A call can be transferred from one user to another in the Konvergo ERP _VoIP_ phone
widget. However, this can **only** occur after speaking to the caller first.
Without picking up the call in the Konvergo ERP _VoIP_ phone widget, the only way to
transfer a call is automatically though the provider console/portal.
