# Use channels for team communication

Use channels in the Konvergo ERP _Discuss_ app to organize discussions between
individual teams, departments, projects, or any other group that requires
regular communication. With channels, employees can communicate inside
dedicated spaces within the Konvergo ERP database around specific topics, updates, and
latest developments having to do with the organization.

## Public and private channels

A _Public_ channel can be seen by everyone, while a _Private_ one is only
visible to users invited to it. To create a new channel, navigate to the
Discuss app, and then click on the **➕ (plus)** icon next to the **Channels**
heading in the left-side menu. After typing the name of the channel, two
selectable options will appear: The first is a channel with a hashtag (`#`) to
indicate that it is a public channel; the second option is a channel with a
lock icon (`🔒`) next to it, to indicate that it is a private channel. Select
the channel type that best fits the communication needs.

Tip</p><p>A public channel is best used when many employees need to access information (such as company
announcements), whereas a private channel could be used whenever information should be limited
to specific groups (such as a specific department).</p>
</div>

### Configuration options

The channel’s **Group Name** , **Description** , and **Privacy** settings can
be modified by clicking on the channel’s settings, represented by a **⚙️
(gear)** icon in the left sidebar menu, next to the channel’s name.

#### Privacy and Members tabs

Changing **Who can follow the group’s activities?** controls which groups can
have access to the channel.

they would a public one.</p>
</div>

When choosing **Invited people only** , specify in the **Members** tab which
members should be invited. Inviting members can also be done from the
_Discuss_ app’s main dashboard, by selecting the channel, clicking the _add
user_ icon in the top-right corner of the dashboard, and finally clicking
**Invite to Channel** once all the users have been added.

When the **Selected group of users** option is selected, it reveals the
ability to add an **Authorized Group** , along with the options to **Auto
Subscribe Groups** and **Auto Subscribe Departments**.

The option to **Auto Subscribe Groups** automatically adds users of that
particular user group as followers. In other words, while **Authorized
Groups** limits which users can access the channel, **Auto Subscribe Groups**
automatically adds users as members as long as they are part of a specific
user group. The same is true for **Auto Subscribe Departments**.

## Quick search bar

Once at least 20 channels, direct messages, or live chat conversations (if
_Live Chat_ module is installed on the database) are pinned in the sidebar, a
**Quick search…** bar is displayed. This feature is a convenient way to filter
conversations and quickly find relevant communications.

### Finding channels

Click on the settings **⚙️ (gear)** icon, located in the left sidebar, to the
right of the **CHANNELS** collapsible menu item. Doing so will lead to a
mosaic view containing all the public channels available. Users can join or
leave channels on this screen by clicking the **JOIN** or **LEAVE** buttons
that appear in the channel boxes.

There is also the ability to apply filtering criteria and save them for later
use. The **Search…** function accepts wildcards by using the underscore
character [ `_` ], and specific searches can be saved by using the Favorites ‣
Save Current Search drop-down menu.

## Linking channel in chatter

Channels can be linked in the chatter (log note) of a record in Konvergo ERP. To do
so, simply type: `#` and the channel name. Click or press enter on the
_channel_ name. Upon logging the note a link to the channel will appear. After
clicking on the link a chat window with the channel conversation will pop up
in the lower right corner of the screen.

Users are able to contribute to this group channel (either public or member
based) by typing messages in window and pressing _enter_.
