# Knowledge

**Odoo Knowledge** is a multipurpose productivity app that allows internal
users to enrich their business knowledge base and provide individually or
collaboratively gathered information.

The pages on which they gather content are called _articles_. They are mainly
composed of a title and a body. The latter is an HTML field containing text,
images, links to other articles, records from other models, templates, etc.
