# Articles editing

## Add and style content

To start adding content, click anywhere on the page. Your cursor is
automatically set to write the article’s first-level header. Once you are done
writing the title, press **enter** on your keyboard to move to the next line.

<span class="dfn"><span>(First-level header)</span></span> title and the article’s name. To change the name of your article

modification.</p>

### Text editor

To stylize the text using the text editor, select the text to format.

Then, you can:

  * Change the style by clicking **Normal**. Doing so opens a dropdown menu with multiple styles to choose from (**Normal, Code, Header 1 → Header 6, Quote**);

  * Format the text. Click **B** to put it in bold, **I** to put it in italic, **U** to underline, and **S** to strikethrough;

  * Change the font color by clicking **A** or the background color by clicking the **pencil** icon:

    * To choose from a predefined theme color, click **Theme** and select the desired color.

    * To customize, click **Solid** and define a color using the wheel, by typing its hex code, or its RGBA values.

    * To use a gradient, click **Gradient** , choose a predefined gradient or click **Custom** to create a personalized gradient.

  * To change the text’s size, click the **size number** and select the desired size;

  * Click the **lists** icons to turn the paragraph into an unordered list, an ordered list, or a checklist;

  * Click the **chain** icon to insert or edit an URL link.

To format a whole paragraph, type `/` anywhere in the text. Doing so opens the
**powerbox** , which allows:

  * Changing a paragraph into lists (unordered, ordered, checklists).

  * Changing a paragraph into a header (1 → 6), normal text, `code`, or _quotes_.

### Cover pictures

You can customize your article by adding a cover picture and an icon. Hover
above the h1 title and click **Add Cover**. A pop-up window opens to set a
cover picture.

If your database and your Unsplash account are associated, the cover picture
is automatically selected based on the article’s name. To modify it, hover
over the picture to make the buttons appear, click **Change Cover** , and
select another image.

Retrieve images from different sources:

  * Search the **Unsplash** database.

  * Enter a picture’s **URL**.

  * **Upload** an image from a computer.

To remove the cover, hover over it to make the buttons appear and click
**Remove Cover**.

<li><p>To associate Unsplash with your database, please refer to
<a href="../../general/integrations/unsplash">Unsplash</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The articles are responsive, and so are the cover pictures. As a result, the images cannot
be repositioned manually to fit a particular screen, as they automatically resize
depending on the device.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

### Icons

To add an icon, hover above the h1 title and click **Add Icon**. Doing this
sets a random emoji automatically. To change it, click it and select one from
the emoji window. To remove it, proceed equally and click the red-circled
**x**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">

<li><p>The emoji is also displayed before the corresponding article in the side panel hierarchic tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the emoji on the side panel to change it without opening the related article.</p></li>
