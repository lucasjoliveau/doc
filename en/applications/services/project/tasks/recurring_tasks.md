# Recurring tasks

When handling a project, the same task often needs to be performed several
times: for example, weekly meetings or status reports. The **recurring tasks**
feature allows you to automate the creation of those tasks.

## Configuration

To enable recurring tasks, go to Project ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, then
activate **Recurring Tasks** , and **Save**.

Recurring tasks are now activated on all existing projects. The feature can be
deactivated on an individual project by clicking the drop-down menu button
**⋮** next to the project name, then going to Settings ‣ Settings ‣ Task
Management and disabling **Recurring Tasks**.

### Set up task recurrence

In an existing task, go to the **Recurrent** tab, then check the **Recurrent**
box. A set of options allows you to configure the frequency: **Days** ,
**Weeks** , **Months** , **Years** , and the number of repetitions.

On the scheduled recurrency date, a new task is created on your project
dashboard with the following configuration:

  * **Stage** : first stage of the project dashboard (**New** or equivalent);

  * **Name** , **Description** , **Project** , **Assignees** , **Customer** , **Tags** : copied from the original task;

  * **Milestones** , **Deadline** , **Timesheets** , **Chatter** , **Activities** : those fields are not copied;

  * **Subtasks** : copied from the original task, which becomes a parent of all the tasks in recurrence;

  * A **smart button** on the task displays the total number of existing recurrences.

Tip</p><p>To see the task in your project dashboard before the scheduled date, consider setting up the
recurrence date to a day earlier.</p>

### Edit or stop task recurrence

**To edit** the recurrence, open the task: a blue banner invites you to choose
whether you wish to apply your changes to this task only or to a sequence of
tasks.

**To stop** the recurrence, open the task, then go to the **Recurrency** tab
and uncheck **Recurrent**.
