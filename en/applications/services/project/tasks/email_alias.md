# Create Project’s Tasks from an Email Alias

When you already have an email address that customers know from the top of
their heads, changing it is the last thing you want to do. Instead, link that
address to your project and transform those conversations into structured
work. It automatically creates a task in the first stage of a project.

## Set up an incoming email server

On the _Settings_ application, enable _External Email Servers_ and define the
incoming email alias you would like to use.

**For more information** : [Send and receive emails in Konvergo ERP with an email
server](../../../general/email_communication/email_servers)

### Configure the email alias in your project

Now that you have the incoming email server set up, go to Project ‣
Configuration ‣ Projects ‣ Edit. Under the _Emails_ tab, define the wanted
email alias and choose the policy to receive a message.

In addition, you can now directly set it when creating a new project.

![In the settings of your project, define the emails alias under the tab email
in Konvergo ERP Project](../../../../_images/email_project.png) <div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>All the recipients of the email (To/Cc/Bcc) are automatically added as followers of the task.</p>
</div>

The email can be seen under the name of your project on the dashboard.
