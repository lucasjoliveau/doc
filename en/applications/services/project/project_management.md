# Project management

Odoo Project uses the **Kanban** project management system. This means all
projects are broken down into tasks, which are categorized on a whiteboard
according to what production phase they are in.

Did you know?

The word **Kanban** comes from Japanese and refers to the “visual board”
management method.

## Configuration

Open the **Project** app and click Create to start a new project. Enter a Name
for your project and click Create Project.

You can customize your existing **projects** from the dashboard by clicking
the drop-down toggle button (⋮) on your project’s **card**.

This enables a new menu divided into four parts:

  * View: see an overview of your project’s components, such as its Tasks, Milestones and Project Updates. Depending on which apps you have activated, more options may be available, such as Documents. All uploaded files can be found under this menu, as well as in the **Documents** app, under Projects;

  * Reporting: analyze your project’s progress and profitability through graphics and statistics;

  * **Color** : make a line of color appear on the left side of the card so that your project is more recognizable;

  * Settings: you can change the following:

    * the Name of the project;

    * the Name of the tasks found under that project;

    * the Customer for whom the project is intended;

    * the Tags used for filtering;

    * the Company responsible for the project;

    * the employee designated as Project Manager;

    * the Planned Date of the project;

    * the total Allocated Hours for that project.

Additionally, you can mark the project as Favorite, allowing you to find it
using the My Favorites filter on the Kanban view;

Further settings are available under the Settings tab. Most of them are _only_
available depending on the activated apps.

## Scheduling activities

You can schedule **activities** (ex. Call, Meeting, etc.) per project by
clicking on the **clock** icon on a project. Doing so opens a list with
already scheduled activities and allows planning **new** activities by
clicking \+ Schedule an activity. On the pop-up window, select the Activity
Type, enter a Summary for that activity, a Due Date, and assign it to an
employee. According to the Activity Type, you may have **additional options**
available.

Note

If an activity is **already** scheduled, the icon may change to a **phone** ,
**group of people** , or other.
