# Project management

Konvergo ERP Project uses the **Kanban** project management system. This means all
projects are broken down into tasks, which are categorized on a whiteboard
according to what production phase they are in.

## Configuration

Open the **Project** app and click **Create** to start a new project. Enter a
**Name** for your project and click **Create Project**.

You can customize your existing **projects** from the dashboard by clicking
the drop-down toggle button (**⋮**) on your project’s **card**.

This enables a new menu divided into four parts:

  * **View** : see an overview of your project’s components, such as its **Tasks** , **Milestones** and **Project Updates**. Depending on which apps you have activated, more options may be available, such as **Documents**. All uploaded files can be found under this menu, as well as in the **Documents** app, under **Projects** ;

  * **Reporting** : analyze your project’s progress and profitability through graphics and statistics;

  * **Color** : make a line of color appear on the left side of the card so that your project is more recognizable;

  * **Settings** : you can change the following:

    * the **Name** of the project;

    * the **Name of the tasks** found under that project;

    * the **Customer** for whom the project is intended;

    * the **Tags** used for filtering;

    * the **Company** responsible for the project;

    * the employee designated as **Project Manager** ;

    * the **Planned Date** of the project;

    * the total **Allocated Hours** for that project.

Additionally, you can mark the project as **Favorite** , allowing you to find
it using the **My Favorites** filter on the Kanban view;

Further settings are available under the **Settings** tab. Most of them are
_only_ available depending on the activated apps.

## Scheduling activities

You can schedule **activities** (ex. **Call** , **Meeting** , etc.) per
project by clicking on the **clock** icon on a project. Doing so opens a list
with already scheduled activities and allows planning **new** activities by
clicking **\+ Schedule an activity**. On the pop-up window, select the
**Activity Type** , enter a **Summary** for that activity, a **Due Date** ,
and assign it to an employee. According to the **Activity Type** , you may
have **additional options** available.

or other.</p>
