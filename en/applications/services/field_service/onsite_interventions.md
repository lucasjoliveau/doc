# Onsite interventions planning

## From a sales order

Allowing your sales team to open onsite interventions creates a seamless
experience for your customers. They can receive a quotation they first have to
approve before the work even starts.

Go to Field Service ‣ Configuration ‣ Products and create or edit a product.

  1. Under the General Information tab, select Service as Product Type.

  2. Under the Sales tab, select Timesheets on tasks as Service Invoicing Policy.

  3. Select Create a task in an existing project as Service Tracking.

  4. Select your Project.

  5. If you use them, select your Worksheet Template, and save.

From the [Sales](../../sales/sales.html) app, create a quotation with the
product and confirm it. A task is automatically set up under your Field
Service project. It is directly accessible from the sales order.

## From helpdesk tickets

The integration with the [Helpdesk](../helpdesk.html) app lets your helpdesk
team manage intervention requests directly. Planning field service tasks from
tickets speeds up your processes.

### Configure the helpdesk team

Go to Helpdesk ‣ Configuration ‣ Helpdesk Teams. Select a team and enable
Onsite Interventions.

Click on it to create a new task under your field service project.
