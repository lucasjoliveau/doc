# HTTPS certificate (IoT)

## What is HTTPS?

_Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure_ (HTTPS) is the secure version of
_Hypertext Transfer Protocol_ (HTTP), which is the primary protocol used to
send data back and forth between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is
encrypted in order to increase the security of data transfer.

HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is
called _Transport Layer Security_ (TLS), although formerly it was known as
_Secure Sockets Layer_ (SSL).

HTTPS occurs based upon the transmission of TLS/SSL certificates, which verify
that a particular provider is who they say they are.

<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>In this documentation and throughout Konvergo ERP the term “HTTPS certificate” will be used to define the
fact that the <abbr title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</abbr> certificate is valid and allows a <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr> connection.</p>
</div>

### Why is it needed?

In order to communicate with certain network devices (in particular for
payment terminals), the usage of HTTPS is mandatory. If the HTTPS certificate
isn’t valid, some devices won’t be able to interact with the IoT Box.

## How to obtain a Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) certificate

The generation of the HTTPS certificate is automatic.

The IoT Box will send a specific request to <https://www.odoo.com> which will
send back the HTTPS certificate if the IoT box and database are eligible.

### Internet of Things (IoT) eligibility

>   1. The database should be a **production** instance. The database instance
> should not be a copy, a duplicate, a staging, or a development environment.
>
>   2. The Konvergo ERP subscription must:
>

>>      * Have an **IoT Box Subscription** line.

>>

>>      * **Status** must be **In Progress**.

>
> If the subscription is linked to a <https://www.odoo.com> portal user check
> the information on the portal subscription page.
>
> ![Konvergo ERP.com portal subscriptions filtered by "in
> progress".](../../../../_images/sub-example-in-progress.png)
>
> In this case, both subscriptions are considered “in progress” as the
> **Filter By: In Progress** was used.

> <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>If the subscription is in question, contact the database’s Account Manager or Partner
regarding the matter.</p>

## Troubleshooting Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) certificate
errors

If anything goes wrong during the process of the “HTTPS certificate”
generation or reception, a specific error will code be given on the IoT box
home page.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Accessing the <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> box homepage will check for the presence of the
“HTTPS certificate” and will attempt its generation if it is missing. As such, if there is an
error on the <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> box home page, refresh the <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> home page to see if the error disappears.</p>
</div>

### `ERR_IOT_HTTPS_CHECK_NO_SERVER`

Reason:

    

The configuration regarding the server is missing. In other words, the Konvergo ERP
instance is not connected with the IoT box.

Solution:

    

Ensure that the server is configured.

</div>

### `ERR_IOT_HTTPS_CHECK_CERT_READ_EXCEPTION`

Reason:

    

An unhandled error happened when trying to read the existing HTTPS
certificate.

Solution:

    

Ensure that the HTTPS certificate file is readable.

### `ERR_IOT_HTTPS_LOAD_NO_CREDENTIAL`

Reason:

    

The contract and/or database UUID is missing.

Solution:

    

Ensure that both values are configured as intended. To modify them, go to the
IoT box home page, and navigate to **Credential**.

### `ERR_IOT_HTTPS_LOAD_REQUEST_EXCEPTION`

Reason:

    

An unexpected error happened when the IoT box tried to reach
<https://www.odoo.com>. The causes are likely due to the network
infrastructure/configuration:

>   * The IoT box does not have access to internet.
>
>   * The network does not allow the IoT box to communicate with
> <https://www.odoo.com>. This may be due to network devices preventing the
> communication (firewalls, etc.) or the network configuration (VPN, etc.).
>

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>More information regarding the error that occurred can be found in the full request
exception details, which are in the <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> box logs.</p>
</div>

Solution:

    <div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>Consult with your system or network administrator should this issue arise. This error code
depends on the network infrastructure and goes beyond Konvergo ERP support’s service scope.</p>
</div> 

### `ERR_IOT_HTTPS_LOAD_REQUEST_STATUS`

Reason:

    

The IoT-box was able to reach <https://www.odoo.com> but received an unusual
[HTTP response (status codes)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

This error code will also give the HTTP response status codes. For example, if
the error reads `ERR_IOT_HTTPS_LOAD_REQUEST_STATUS 404` it means that the page
returned a 404 error, which is the “Page Not Found” code.

Solution:

    

Check if <https://www.odoo.com> is down using a web browser, as it’s possible
that it is down due to maintenance.

>   * If <https://www.odoo.com> is down due to maintenance, unfortunately
> there is nothing that can be done but instead wait for it to recover.
>
>   * If <https://www.odoo.com> is not down due to maintenance, open a
> [support ticket](https://www.odoo.com/help) on the matter. Ensure that the 3
> digits status code next to the code error is included in the support ticket.
>
>

### `ERR_IOT_HTTPS_LOAD_REQUEST_NO_RESULT`

Reason:

    

The IoT box was able to reach <https://www.odoo.com> but it refused to deliver
the HTTPS certificate.

Solution:

    

Ensure that the IoT box and database are eligible for a certificate: Internet
of Things (IoT) eligibility.

## How to ensure that the HTTPS certificate is correct

If the certificate has been applied successfully, a new HTTPS URL for the IoT
box ending with `.odoo-iot.com` will appear on the Konvergo ERP database, inside of
the IoT application on that specific device’s form.

![Konvergo ERP IoT app IoT box with .odoo-iot.com domain.](../../../../_images/odoo-
new-domain.png)

When navigating to the URL in a browser a secured HTTPS connection will be
established.

![Example of valid SSL certificate details on the
browser.](../../../../_images/secured-connection.png)

Padlock in Chrome on Windows 10 attesting the fact that the connection is
secured in HTTPS.

The IoT-box homepage will now display an `OK` status next to `HTTPS
certificate`. The drop-down menu icon, when clicked, will reveal information
regarding the certificate.

status.](../../../../_images/status-ok.png)

## Domain Name System (DNS) issue

If the IoT box can be accessed from its IP address but not the Konvergo ERP assigned
domain: `.odoo-iot.com`; then the IoT box is likely running into a DNS issue.
On some browsers, it will give an error code mentioning DNS (like
`DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN`).

These DNS issues may appear as the following in different browsers:

ChromeFirefoxEdge

![DNS issue on Chrome browser on Windows 10.](../../../../_images/dns-
chrome.png)

DNS issue on Chrome browser on Windows 10.

![DNS issue on Firefox browser on Windows 10.](../../../../_images/dns-
firefox.png)

DNS issue on Firefox browser on Windows 10.

![DNS issue on Edge browser on Windows 10.](../../../../_images/dns-edge.png)

DNS issue on Edge browser on Windows 10.

### Domain Name System (DNS) issue solution

  1. Should the router allow the DNS to be manually changed, change the DNS to use [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns).

  2. If your router doesn’t allow for this, then a change will need to be made on the DNS settings of each of the devices using [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns). This will need to occur on **every** device that plans to interact with the IoT box (e.g. computer, tablet or phone). The individual device configuration processes can be found on the website of the device’s manufacturer.
