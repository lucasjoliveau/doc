# Use an IoT box with a PoS

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure the following equipment is available:

  * An IoT box, with its power adapter.

  * A computer or tablet with an up-to-date web browser.

  * Konvergo ERP Online or an Konvergo ERP instance with the _Point of Sale_ and _IoT_ applications installed.

  * A local network set up with DHCP (this is the default setting).

  * An RJ45 Ethernet Cable (optional, but preferred over WiFi, which is already built in).

  * Any of the supported hardware (receipt printer, barcode scanner, cash drawer, payment terminal, scale, customer display, etc.). The list of supported hardware can be found on the [POS Hardware page](https://www.odoo.com/page/point-of-sale-hardware).

## Setup

A suggested configuration for a point of sale system.

To connect hardware to the PoS, the first step is to connect an IoT box to the
database. To do this, follow these instructions: [Connect an Internet of
Things (IoT) box to the Konvergo ERP database](connect).

Then, connect the peripheral devices to the IoT box.

Device Name | Instructions  
---|---  
Printer | Connect a supported receipt printer to a USB port or to the network, and power it on. Refer to [Orders printing](../../../sales/point_of_sale/restaurant/kitchen_printing).  
Cash drawer | The cash drawer should be connected to the printer with an RJ25 cable.  
Barcode scanner | In order for the barcode scanner to be compatible it must end barcodes with an `ENTER` character (keycode 28). This is most likely the default configuration of the barcode scanner.  
Scale | Connect the scale and power it on. Refer to [Connect a scale](../devices/scale).  
Customer display | Connect a screen to the IoT box to display the PoS order. Refer to [Connect a screen](../devices/screen).  
Payment terminal | The connection process depends on the terminal. Refer to the [payment terminals documentation](../../../sales/point_of_sale/payment_methods).  
  
Once this is completed, connect the IoT box to the PoS application. To do
this, go to Point of Sale ‣ Configuration ‣ PoS, tick the **IoT Box** option,
and select the devices to be used in this PoS. **Save** the the changes.

Once set up is done, a new PoS session can be launched.
