Note

The Open Platform Communications (OPC) Unified Architecture (UA) protocol is
now supported by the IoT box. OPC UA is an open standard that specifies
information exchange for industrial communication on devices, between machines
and between systems. This includes communication between information
technology and operational technology. OPC UA can be used with any software
platform, on a wide variety of devices, and deployed securely. The IoT box has
entered the world of the Industry 4.0 standard and can be utilized in a wide
variety of industries, and for things like building automation, packaging,
utilities, etc.
