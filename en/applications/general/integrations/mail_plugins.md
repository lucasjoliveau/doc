Mail Plugins are connectors that bridge your mailbox with your Odoo database.
With them, you can interact with your Odoo database directly from your mailbox
by:

  * Creating leads and centralizing prospects’ emails into the CRM app.

  * Generating tasks in any Odoo project.

  * Creating tickets in the Helpdesk app.

  * Searching and storing insights on your contacts.

Mail Plugins are available for [Outlook](mail_plugins/outlook.html) and
[Gmail](mail_plugins/gmail.html).

## Pricing

Mail Plugins are **free** to install and use.

However, they can provide **Lead Enrichment** , which is part of a paid
service known as **Lead Generation**.

Mail plugins allow you to test Lead Enrichment for free, whether you connect
the plugins to a database or not. After a while, the plugins ask you to buy
[In-app purchases (IAP)](../../essentials/in_app_purchase.html) credits if you
would like to keep using this service.

### Lead Generation IAP service

Lead Enrichment uses the _Lead Generation IAP service_. Each request consumes
one _Lead Generation credit_.

To buy credits, go to Settings ‣ CRM ‣ Lead Enrichment ‣ Buy credits and
select a package.

Note

  * If you are out of credits, the only information populated when clicking on the suggested company is its website link and logo.

  * Check out the [Lead Generation IAP service Privacy Policy](https://iap.odoo.com/privacy#header_3).
