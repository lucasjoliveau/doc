# Digest emails

_Digest Emails_ are periodic snapshots sent via email to users in an
organization that include high-level information about how the business is
performing.

To start sending digest emails, begin by navigating to Settings app ‣
Statistics section, activate the Digest Emails feature, and click Save.

email-settings.png)

A variety of settings can be configured for digest emails, such as:

  * Deciding which KPIs are shared in the digest emails

  * Determining how often digest emails are sent

  * Choosing who in the organization receives digest emails

  * Creating custom digest email templates

  * Adding additional KPIs (_Studio_ app required)

Note

By default, the Digest Email feature is enabled. Your Odoo Periodic Digest
serves as the primary template, which includes all KPI measurements across the
Odoo database, and is sent daily to administrators.

Warning

When creating duplicates of databases that have sending capabilities (not
testing-mode), the digest emails continue to send from the duplicate database,
unless deactivated.

To deactivate the digest email, navigate to Settings ‣ Statistics section.
Then, deactivate the Digest Emails feature, by un-ticking the checkbox, and
clicking Save. See the section on Deactivate digest email.

## Customize default digest email

To customize the default digest email (_Your Odoo Periodic Digest_), go to
Settings app ‣ Statistics section ‣ Digest Email field. Then, select Your Odoo
Periodic Digest, and click on the ↗️ (External link) icon, next to the drop-
down menu selection.

A pop-up window appears, and presents a variety of editable settings, which
include:

  * Digest Name: the name of the digest email.

  * Periodicity: control how often digest emails are sent (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly).

  * Next Send Date: the date on which the digest email will be sent again.

  * KPIs tab: check/uncheck each calculated KPI that appears in digest emails. A ticked box indicates an active KPI in the digest email. See the section on KPIs.

  * Recipients tab: add/remove users who receive the digest emails. See the section on Recipients.

Note

The KPIs can be customized using Odoo _Studio_. Additional costs to the
database subscription are incurred should _Studio_ need to be installed. See
this section on Custom KPIs with Odoo Studio.

From there, give the digest email a Digest Name, specify Periodicity, choose
the desired KPIs, and add Recipients, as needed.

After clicking Save, the new custom digest email is available as a selection
in the Digest Email field, located in the Settings app ‣ Statistics section.

## Custom KPIs with Odoo Studio

The KPIs on a digest email template form, in the KPIs tab, can be customized
using Odoo _Studio_.

Warning

Additional costs to the database subscription are incurred, should Odoo
_Studio_ need to be installed.

To begin, click the 🛠️ (tools) icon in the top-right of the screen. This is
the link to the Odoo _Studio_ application.

In order to create additional fields, create two fields on the digest object:

  1. Create a boolean field called `kpi_myfield`, and display it in the KPIs tab.

  2. Create a computed field called `kpi_myfield_value` that computes the customized KPI.

  3. Select the KPIs in the KPIs tab.

Tip

Here is the [source
code](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/15.0/addons/digest/models/digest.py)
for the `digest.py` file, which guides the programmer in the coding of the
computed field.

Users can also click the Recipients tab, and then the vertical three-dot

to modify this tab.
