# Returns and refunds

The Konvergo ERP _Sales_ app provides two different ways to process returns. The
method used depends on whether or not an invoice has been sent.

## Before invoicing

Returns are completed using _Reverse Transfers_ when a customer decides to
return a product **before** an invoice has been sent or validated.

To start a return before invoicing, navigate to the Sales app, select the
desired sales order, and click on the **Delivery** smart button to open the
associated delivery order.

On the validated delivery order, click **Return**.

This opens a **Reverse Transfer** pop-up window.

By default, the **Quantity** matches the validated quantities from the
delivery order. Update the quantities, if necessary. Click on the **üóëÔ∏è
(trash)** icon next to a line item to remove it from the return.

Next, click **Return** to confirm the return. This generates a new warehouse
operation for the incoming returned product(s).

Upon receiving the return, the warehouse team validates the warehouse
operation by clicking **Validate**. Then, on the original sales order, the
**Delivered** quantity updates to reflect the difference between the initial
validated quantities and the returned quantities.

When an invoice is created, the customer receives an invoice **only** for the
products they are keeping, if any.

## After invoicing

Sometimes, customers return an item after they receive and/or pay for their
invoice. In these cases, a return using only _Reverse Transfers_ is
insufficient since validated, or sent, invoices cannot be changed.

However, _Reverse Transfers_ can be used in conjunction with _Credit Notes_ to
complete the customer‚Äôs return.

To start a return after invoicing, navigate to the relevant sales order in the
Sales app.

If there is a payment registered on the sales order, the payment details
appear in the chatter, and the invoice (accessible through the **Invoices**
smart button) has a green **In Payment** banner.

From the sales order, click on the **Delivery** smart button to view the
validated delivery order. Then, click **Return** to open the **Reverse
Transfer** pop-up window.

Next, edit the **Product** and/or **Quantity** , as needed for the return.
Then, click **Return**. This generates a new warehouse operation for the
incoming returned product(s), which is validated by the warehouse team once
the return is received by clicking **Validate**.

Then, on the sales order, the **Delivered** quantity updates to reflect the
difference between the initial validated quantities and the returned
quantities.

To process a refund, navigate to the relevant invoice (from the sales order,
click on the **Invoices** smart button). Then, click the **Credit Note**
button at the top of the validated invoice.

Doing so reveals a **Credit Note** pop-up form.

Start by entering a **Reason displayed on Credit Note** and a specific
**Journal** to process the credit. Then, select a specific **Reversal Date**.

After the information is filled in, click **Reverse** or **Reverse and Create
Invoice**. Then, edit the draft, if needed.

Lastly, click **Confirm** to confirm the credit note.

When complete, a blue banner reading: **You have outstanding credits for this
customer. You can allocate them to mark this invoice as paid.** appears at the
top of the page.
