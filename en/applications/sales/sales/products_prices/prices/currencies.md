# Foreign currencies

With Odoo, pricelists can be used to manage prices in a number of foreign
currencies. Specifically, Odoo has the ability to work with 167 total
currencies.

Note

In order to use multiple currencies in Odoo _Sales_ , the _Accounting_
application **must** be installed.

## Settings

Once the _Accounting_ app has been installed, foreign currencies can be added
to the database. Navigate to Accounting app ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, scroll
to the Currencies section, and locate the Main Currency setting.

![How the main currency feature appears on settings page in Odoo
Accounting.](../../../../../_images/main-currency-setting-page.png)

Odoo automatically sets the main currency as the currency of the country the
company is based in.

To change the main currency of the company, select the drop-down menu in the
Currency field, select the desired currency, and be sure to Save the changes.

Tip

To ensure currency rates are updated automatically, enable the _automatic
currency rates_ feature on the _Accounting_ settings page (Accounting app ‣
Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Currencies section).

![How the main currency feature appears on settings page in Odoo
Accounting.](../../../../../_images/automatic-currency-rates.png)

Click the checkbox beside the Automatic Currency Rates feature, choose a
designated bank to get the currency rates from in the Service field drop-down
menu, and select an Interval of time for the updates to take place. Then
determine when the date of the Next Run should be.

To instantly update the currency rates, click the 🔁 (circular arrows) icon,
located to the right of the Next Run field.

When all configurations are complete, be sure to Save all changes.

Note

All payment methods **must** be in the same currency as the sales journal, or
the company currency, if the company currency is not set. If it is not the
same, a Validation Error message appears.

## View, edit, and add currencies

To view, edit, and add currencies to the database, making them available on
pricelists and on the Main Currency drop-down menu, click the Currencies link,
located beneath the Currency field on the Accounting app ‣ Settings page.

When the Currencies link is clicked, a separate Currencies page is revealed.

![How the main currencies page appears in Odoo
Accounting.](../../../../../_images/main-currencies-page.png)

On this page, Odoo provides a master list of 167 global currencies. Each row
shows the corresponding Currency, Symbol, Name, date of the Last Update, and
Current Rate (compared to the default currency of the country in which the
company is based).

To the far right, there are two columns, which can be toggled on or off:

  * Use on eBay: this currency can be used with the connected eBay account (if applicable).

  * Active: this currency is activated, which means it can be added to a pricelist, or used as the main currency of the company, if desired (via Accounting app ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Currencies section).

Note

By default, all the Active currency options are at the top of the list.

Tip

It is recommended that _at least_ one pricelist is created per Active
currency. See [Pricelists, discounts, and formulas](pricing.html) to learn
more about pricelist configuration.

To toggle options on/off, click the toggle switch in the row for the
corresponding column. When _on_ the color of the switch is green. When _off_ ,
the color of the switch is grey.

### Currency detail form

To edit any currency on the Currencies page, click the desired currency to
reveal the detail form for that specific currency, and proceed to make any
necessary changes.

![How a currency detail form looks in Odoo
Accounting.](../../../../../_images/currency-detail-form.png)

On the currency detail form, the relevant currency code appears in the
Currency field. Beneath that, the name for the currency is in the Name field.

Then, toggle the currency’s availability with the Active toggle: _on_ is
indicated with a green switch, and _off_ is indicated with a grey switch.

On the right of the currency detail form, the appropriate Currency Unit (e.g.
`Dollars`) and Currency Subunit (e.g. `Cents`) can be found.

If the currency is meant to be used for eBay purposes, toggle the Use on eBay
option to the desired activation.

Next, under the Rates tab, the various conversion rates can be viewed, added,
or deleted. Each row shows the Date of that specific rate, the Company to
which it is connected, followed by the Unit per… and …per Unit.

Note

The _…_ in each of the last two columns represents the main currency set for
the company. For example, if the main currency is set to `USD`, the columns
are titled Unit per USD and USD per Unit.

To add a new rate, click Add a line in the Rates tab, and proceed to fill in
the necessary information in the aforementioned columns.

### Main currency detail form

If the selected currency is the main currency of the company, a blue banner
appears at the top of the currency detail form with the message: This is your
company’s currency..

![How a main currency detail form looks in Odoo
Accounting.](../../../../../_images/main-currency-detail-form.png)

All the fields are the same as a typical currency detail form, but there will
**not** be a Rates tab because all other currency rates are based off the main
currency of the company.

## Create new currency

If a desired currency isn’t on the Currencies page, click the New button to
open a blank currency template form.

Tip

The same New button is located in the upper-right corner of any currency
detail form.

![How a blank currency detail form looks in Odoo
Accounting.](../../../../../_images/blank-currency-detail-form.png)

On the blank currency detail form, proceed to enter the desired currency code
in the Currency field. Beneath that, enter the name for the currency in the
Name field.

Then, toggle the currency’s availability with the Active toggle switch.

On the right of the currency detail form, enter the appropriate Currency Unit
(e.g. `Dollars`) and appropriate Currency Subunit (e.g. `Cents`).

If the currency is meant to be used for eBay purposes, toggle the Use on eBay
to the desired activation.

Next, under the Rates tab, add a new rate by clicking Add a line. Then,
proceed to confirm and adjust the Date, Company, Unit per…, and …per Unit
fields to ensure all the auto-populated information is accurate.

Note

The _…_ in each of the last two columns represents the main currency set for
the company. For example, if the main currency is set to `USD`, the columns
are titled Unit per USD and USD per Unit.

## Currency-specific pricelists

It is recommended that _at least_ one pricelist is created per active currency
in the database. To create (or assign) a pricelist to a specific currency,
start by navigating to Sales app ‣ Products ‣ Pricelists.

From the Pricelists page, either select an existing pricelist to edit, or
click New to create a new pricelist.

On the pricelist detail form, for either a new or existing pricelist, adjust
the Currency field as desired.

[Pricelists, discounts, and formulas](pricing.html) to learn more about
pricelist configuration.

## Auto-conversion from public price

It should be noted that the public price seen on products is directly related
to the main currency the company has set, which is configured by navigating to
Accounting app ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Currencies section ‣ Main Currency
‣ Currency drop-down menu.

The sales price automatically updates if the pricelist is changed to a
different pricelist that has a different currency than the company’s main
currency. The change in price is directly related to the updated conversion
rate for that currency.

## Set product prices

In order to have product prices set in place to avoid any changes in currency
rates, start by navigating to Sales app ‣ Products ‣ Products.

From the Products page, select the desired product to modify. Or, create a new
product by clicking the New button.

Then, on the product detail form, click the Extra Prices smart button, located
in the upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a separate Price Rules page,
specific to that particular product.

![How to set product prices based on foreign currency pricelists in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/price-rules-currencies.png)

Click New, and select the desired pricelist from the drop-down menu in the
Pricelist column.

The Applied On field is auto-populated with the product, so proceed to enter
in the desired figures in the Min. Quantity and Price fields.

Note

The figure in the Min. Quantity field means the Price being set will **only**
trigger if at least that amount of product is purchased.

If necessary, configure a Start Date and End Date for the set prices. Leaving
those columns blank ensures the set price will remain valid, regardless of the
date of sale.

If working in a multi-company environment, designate to which company this
price rule should be applied in the Company field. Leaving that field blank
ensures the price rule applies to all companies in the database.

With those configurations complete, regardless of any changes/updates in
conversion, whenever those designated pricelists are applied to a customer
trying to purchase this specific product, these pre-determined set prices
appear.
