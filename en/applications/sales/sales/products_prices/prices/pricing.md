# Pricelists, discounts, and formulas

Odoo _Sales_ has a useful pricelist feature that can be tailored to fit any
unique pricing strategy.

A _pricelist_ is a list of prices (or price rules) that Odoo uses to determine
the appropriate price for a customer. These pricelists can be set with
specific criteria (such as time periods, minimum quantity sold, and more) in
order to apply certain prices or discounts.

Pricelists suggest certain prices, but they can always be overridden on the
sales order.

## Pricing strategy options

To choose a pricing strategy, first navigate to Sales app ‣ Configuration ‣
Settings. In the Pricing section, click the checkbox next to the Pricelists
feature.

Doing so reveals two additional options beneath it: Multiple prices per
product and Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas). A link labeled
Pricelists also appears, which leads to a separate pricelists page, wherein
pricelists can be created and/or modified.

  * Multiple prices per product: provides the option to set several different prices per product.

  * Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas): provides the option to create detailed price rules and apply discounts, margins, and roundings.

Sales.](../../../../../_images/pricelist-feature-setting.png)

After clicking the checkbox beside the Pricelists feature, select one of those
two options, then click Save to save all changes.

## Pricelists

After activating and saving the Pricelists feature, the Settings page reloads
and, from here, either select the Pricelists link (beneath the Pricelists
feature on the Settings page), or navigate to Sales app ‣ Products ‣
Pricelists.

Either option reveals the Pricelists page, in which pricelists can be created
and/or modified at any time.

![How the pricelists page looks in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/pricelists-page.png)

Note

The Public Pricelist is the default pricelist used with Odoo _Sales_ and
_eCommerce_.

From the Pricelists page, either select the desired pricelist to edit, or
click New to create a new pricelist, which reveals a blank pricelist form that
can be configured in a number of different ways.

![How the pricelist detail form looks in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/pricelist-detail-form.png)

When creating a new pricelist, start by adding a name for the pricelist at the
top of the form, in the blank field. Next, select which Currency should be
used.

Then, if working in a multi-company environment, select which company this
pricelist should apply to in the Company field. If this field is left blank,
the pricelist is automatically applied to all companies in the database.

### Price rules tab

The Price Rules tab functionality on a pricelist form varies depending on the
Pricelists setting chosen: either Multiple prices per product or Advanced
price rules (discounts, formulas).

However, the Time-based rules tab and Configuration tab are always the same,
regardless of the chosen Pricelists setting.

#### Price rules tab (multiple prices per product)

With the Multiple prices per product setting activated, the Price Rules tab on
pricelist forms provides the option to add specific products, with a specific
price, to a pricelist.

To add a specific product and price to a pricelist form, click the Price Rules
tab, then click Add a line in the Products column. Then, select the desired
product for which a specific price should be applied.

Next, if necessary, select a product variant under the Variants column (e.g. a
specific product size, color, etc.). If no variants are selected, then this
price will apply to all variants of the product.

If a minimum amount of the product must be purchased in order to apply the
specific price, enter the amount under the Min. Quantity column.

To configure the price of the product for this specific pricelist, enter the
desired amount under the Price column. Then, there is the option to add a
Start Date and End Date to the configured product price, if desired.

To add another product line, click Add a line again, and repeat the process.
There is no limit to how many products can be added in the Price Rules tab of
a pricelist form.

For more information, check out the following section: Multiple prices per
product.

#### Price rules tab (advanced price rules)

With the Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas) setting activated, the
Price Rules tab on pricelist forms provides the option to configure detailed
price rules based on formulas.

Check out the Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas) section for detailed
steps on how to add advanced price rules to a pricelist.

### Time-based rules tab

Time-based rules are used specifically with [subscription
products](../../../subscriptions/products.html). Be sure to check out the Odoo
_Subscriptions_ [documentation](../../../subscriptions.html).

Under the Time-based rules tab, the same functionality of the Price Rules tab
is present, with the only difference being that a repeating time period can be
applied in the Period column.

After a Product and potential Variant are selected in the Time-based rules
tab, select the blank field in the Period column to reveal a drop-down menu of
pre-designated recurrence periods (e.g. `Monthly`, `Quarterly`, `Weekly`,
etc.).

New recurrence periods can also be directly created from this column, by
typing in the new name for the Period and then selecting Create to create the
time period, which can be edited later. Or, select Create and edit… to reveal
a pop-up form, in which the new recurrence period can be directly configured.

![Custom time period pop-up form in Odoo Sales.](../../../../../_images/time-
period-popup.png)

From this Create Period pop-up form, add a Name, Duration, then a Unit (e.g.
`Days`, `Weeks`, etc.). When finished, click Save and Close.

Lastly, add the desired price for this time-based rule in the Price column.

### Configuration tab

Under the Configuration tab, there are a few options that can further
customize the pricelist.

![Configuration tab on pricelist detail form in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/configuration-tab.png)

From here, under the Availability section, in the Country Groups field,
certain country groups can be added to the pricelist. There is no limit to how
many country groups can be added in this field.

Note

If no country is set for a customer, Odoo takes the first pricelist without
any country group.

Under the Website section, there are a few options that can be configured. In
the Website field, this pricelist can be applied to a specific website, if
working in a multi-website environment. If left blank, the pricelist will be
applied to all websites in the database.

Click the Selectable checkbox to have this pricelist as a selectable option
for customers to choose as they shop. If the Selectable box is left unchecked,
customers **cannot** select this pricelist for themselves as they shop.

Lastly, there is the option to add an E-commerce Promotional Code. To add a
code, type in the desired promo code that, when entered during the checkout
process, applies the pricelist to the customer, even if the customer does not
fall into the previously-specified criteria.

#### Show discount percentage to customers

With Odoo _Sales_ , the option to show the public price _and_ the computed
discount percentage on the product catalog is available.

To do that, navigate to Sales app ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, and in the
Pricing section, click the checkbox next to the Discounts feature, and then
click Save to save all changes.

After activating the Discounts feature, navigate to the pricelists page,
either by clicking the Pricelists link from the Settings page, or by going to
Sales app ‣ Products ‣ Pricelists.

On the Pricelists page, select the desired pricelist to edit. On the pricelist
form, click into the Configuration tab. In the Configuration tab, at the
bottom, a Discounts section is now available.

![What the discount options are on the configuration tab of a pricelist in
Odoo Sales.](../../../../../_images/configuration-discount-options.png)

The options available in this section are:

  * Discount included in the price: shows the customer only the final price with the discount already included.

  * Show public price & discount to the customer: shows the customer the public price _and_ the discount they’re earning.

## Customer pricelist application

While the default pricelist applied to any customer is the Public Pricelist,
Odoo provides the opportunity to directly apply a different pricelist to
customers on their contact form.

To do that, open the desired customer’s contact form, either by navigating to
Sales app ‣ Orders ‣ Customers and selecting the customer from the main
Customers page, or by clicking on the customer’s name on a sales order.

![Sample customer detail form in Odoo Sales.](../../../../../_images/customer-
detail-form.png)

On the desired customer’s contact form, under the Sales & Purchase tab, in the
Sales section, designate what pricelist should be applied to this specific
customer from the drop-down menu in the Pricelist field.

![The pricelist field in a customer detail form in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/customer-form-pricelist-field.png)

## Multiple prices per product

To apply several prices per individual product, select the Multiple prices per
product option, after enabling the Pricelists feature on the _Sales_ app
setting page (Sales app ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings), and click Save.

Next, apply pricelists to specific products using the product form. Navigate
to the Sales app ‣ Products ‣ Products and select the product for which
multiple prices should be applied. Selecting a product from the Products page
reveals that specific product’s product form on a separate page.

On the product form, click the Extra Prices smart button, located at the top
of the form.

![How the extra prices smart button appears in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/extra-prices-smartbutton.png)

Doing so reveals a separate page displaying the Price Rules that are specific
to that particular product. Here, price rules can be edited or created at any
time.

![How the extra price rules per product page appears in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/price-rules-product-page.png)

To create a new price rule for a product from this specific Price Rules page,
click New to add a new, customizable row that has the desired product already
populated in the Applied On column.

Next, select which Pricelist this specific product price rule should apply to,
via the drop-down menu in the Pricelist column.

Note

The Public Pricelist is the default pricelist used with Odoo _Sales_ and
_eCommerce_.

Tip

To create a new pricelist from this page, type in the desired name of the new
pricelist in the Pricelist column, then select Create from the drop-down menu.
All pricelists can be modified at any time, by navigating to Sales app ‣
Products ‣ Pricelists. Pricelists can also be created on that specific
Pricelists page, as well.

After the desired pricelist is added to the row, designate a Min. Quantity for
the price rule.

Example

If the Min. Quantity column is set to `2`, the new price in the Price column
will be applied to orders of 2 or more products. So, in theory, if a single
product costs $100, customers can be encouraged to buy more, if the Price is
set at $85 per product for a Min. Quantity of `2` products.

Next, enter the desired amount in the Price column. Then, if needed, enter a
Start Date and End Date for the product’s price rule.

And lastly, if working in a multi-company environment, select which company
this price rule should be applied to in the Company field. Leaving this field
blank means the price rule applies for all companies in the database.

Click away from the row to activate Odoo’s auto-save capability, meaning that
newly-created price rule is now ready to be used.

Proceed to add as many unique price rules per product as desired. There is no
limit to how many price rules can be added per product.

With the price rule(s) in place for a specific product, customers who fall
into those corresponding pricelists automatically see those new prices
applied. The number of price rules applied to a particular product are also
displayed in the Extra Prices smart button, located on every product form.

Note

When a price rule/pricelist is added to a product via the Extra Prices smart
button, it is also reflected on the pricelist itself. Similarly, when a price
rule for a specific product is added to a pricelist, it is also reflected on
the product form via the Extra Prices smart button.

## Advanced price rules

The Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas) pricelist feature provides the
option to set price change rules based on discounts and formulas. These
changes can be relative to the product list/catalog price, the product’s cost,
or another pricelist.

To use advanced pricing rules, with discounts and formulas, select the
Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas) option, after enabling the
Pricelists feature on the _Sales_ app setting page (Sales app ‣ Configuration
‣ Settings), and click Save.

After activating and saving that Pricelists feature, the Settings page reloads
and, from here, either select the Pricelists link (beneath the Pricelists
feature on the Settings page), or navigate to Sales app ‣ Products ‣
Pricelists.

Either option reveals the Pricelists page, in which pricelists can be created
and/or modified at any time.

From the Pricelists page, select a desired pricelist to modify, or create a
new pricelist by clicking the New button.

On the pricelist form, under the Price Rules tab, click Add a line to add an
advanced price rule. Doing so reveals a Create Pricelist Rules pop-up form, in
which the advanced rule is configured.

![How the Create Pricelist Rules pop-up form looks in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/create-pricelist-rules-popup.png)

### Price computation

On this form, first choose one of the three Computation options:

  * Fixed Price: the price computation is based on a fixed price.

  * Discount: the price computation is based on a discount.

  * Formula: the price computation is based on a formula.

Note

Each Computation option reveals its own computation-specific fields on the
form.

If Fixed Price is selected, enter the desired price in the Fixed Price field
below. If Discount is selected, enter the desired discount percentage in the
Discount field that appears.

If Formula is selected, a number of configurable options appear.

![The various formula computation options present in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/formula-computation-options.png)

To configure the Formula computation option, start by selecting an option from
the Based on field: Sales Price, Cost, or Other Pricelist. This determines
what the advanced price rule formula will be based on.

Next, in the Discount field, determine how much of a discount should be
applied. It should be noted that a mark-up can be applied by setting a
negative discount in this field.

Example

To formulate a 100% markup (or 2 times the cost of the product), with a $5
minimum margin, set the Based on field to Cost, the Discount to `-100`, and
the Margins to `5`. This is often seen in retail situations.

![How it looks to formulate a markup cost with 5 dollar minimum margin in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/formula-markup-cost-example.png)

Then, in the Extra Fee field, specify a fixed amount to add (or subtract) to
the amount calculated with the discount. After that, enter a desired figure in
the Rounding Method field. The rounding method sets the price so that it is a
multiple of the value in the field.

Note

Rounding is applied _after_ the discount and _before_ the surcharge.

Tip

To have prices that end in 9.99, set the Rounding Method to `10` and the Extra
Fee to `-0.01`.

Lastly, specify the minimum amount of margin over the base price in the
Margins field.

Once all formula-related configurations are complete, Odoo provides an example
of the formula in a blue block to the right of the configurations.

Example

To apply 20% discounts, with prices rounded up to 9.99, set the Based on field
to Sales Price, the Discount field to `20`, the Extra Fee field to `-0.01`,
and the Rounding Method field to `10`.

![Example of a 20% discount with prices rounded to 9.99 in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../../_images/formula-discount-example.png)

### Conditions

At the bottom of the Create Pricelist Rules pop-up form is the Conditions
section.

Here, start by selecting one of the options in the Apply On field:

  * All Products: the advanced pricelist rule will be applied to all products.

  * Product Category: the advanced pricelist rule will be applied to a specific category of products.

  * Product: the advanced pricelist rule will be applied to a specific product.

  * Product Variant: the advanced pricelist rule will be applied to a specific product variant.

If any of those options, apart from All Products, are selected, a new option-
specific field appears, in which the specific Product Category, Product, or
Product Variant must be chosen.

Then, select a minimum quantity to be applied to the advanced pricelist rule
in the Min. Quantity field. Lastly, select a range of dates for the pricelist
item validation in the Validity field.

Once all configurations are complete, either click Save & Close to save the
advanced pricelist rule, or click Save & New to immediately create another
advanced pricelist rule on a fresh form.

Note

If a price rule is set for a particular product, and another one for its
product category, Odoo takes the rule of the product itself.
