# Quotation templates

In Odoo _Sales_ , salespeople have the ability to create reusable quotation
templates for common products or services that the business offers.

By using these templates, quotations can be tailored and sent to customers at
a much faster pace, without having to create new quotations from scratch every
time a sales negotiation occurs.

## Configuration

Begin by activating the setting in Sales app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings, and
scroll to the Quotations & Orders heading.

In that section, check the box beside the Quotation Templates option. Doing so
reveals a new Default Template field, in which a default quotation template
can be chosen from a drop-down menu.

![How to enable quotation templates on Odoo
Sales.](../../../../_images/quotations-templates-setting.png)

Also, upon activating the Quotation Template feature, an internal ‚û°Ô∏è Quotation
Templates link appears beneath the Default Template field.

Clicking that link reveals the Quotation Templates page, from which templates
can be created, viewed, and edited.

Before leaving the Settings page, don‚Äôt forget to click the Save button to
save all changes made during the session.

## Create quotation templates

Click the Quotation Templates link on the Settings page, or navigate to Sales
app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Quotation Templates. Both options reveal the Quotation
Templates page, where quotation templates can be created, viewed, and edited.

![Quotation templates page in the Odoo Sales
application.](../../../../_images/quotation-templates-page.png)

To create a new quotation template, click the New button, located in the
upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a blank quotation template form that can
be customized in a number of ways.

![Create a new quotation template on Odoo Sales.](../../../../_images/blank-
quotation-form.png)

Start by entering a name for the template in the Quotation Template field.

Then, in the Quotation expires after field, designate how many days the
quotation template will remain valid for, or leave the field on the default
`0` to keep the template valid indefinitely.

If the Online Signature and/or Online Payment features are activated in the
Settings (Sales app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings), those options are available
in the Online confirmation field.

In the Online confirmation field, check the box beside Signature to request an
online signature from the customer to confirm an order. Check the box beside
Payment to request an online payment from the customer to confirm an order.

Both options can be enabled simultaneously, in which case the customer must
provide **both** a signature **and** a payment to confirm an order.

Next, in the Confirmation Mail field, click the blank field to reveal a drop-
down menu. From the drop-down menu, select a pre-configured email template to
be sent to customers upon confirmation of an order.

Tip

To create a new email template directly from the Confirmation Mail field,
start typing the name of the new email template in the field, and select
either: Create or Create and edit‚Ä¶ from the drop-down menu that appears.

Selecting Create creates the email template, which can be edited later.
Selecting Create and edit‚Ä¶ creates the email template, and a Create
Confirmation Mail pop-up window appears, in which the email template can be
customized and configured right away.

![Create confirmation mail pop-up window from the quotation template form in
Odoo Sales.](../../../../_images/create-confirmation-mail-popup.png)

When all modifications are complete, click Save & Close to save the email
template and return to the quotation form.

If working in a multi-company environment, use the Company field to designate
to which company this quotation template applies.

In the Recurrence field, choose from a variety of pre-configured amounts of
time (e.g. Monthly, Quarterly) to designate how often this quotation template
should occur.

Note

The Recurrence field **only** applies to subscription plans. For more
information, check out the documentation on [Subscription
plans](../../subscriptions/plans.html).

### Lines tab

In the Lines tab, products can be added to the quotation template by clicking
Add a product, organized by clicking Add a section (and dragging/dropping
section headers), and further explained with discretionary information (such
as warranty details, terms, etc.) by clicking Add a note.

![Populated lines tab on a quotation template form in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../_images/lines-tab-quotation-template.png)

To add a product to a quotation template, click Add a product in the Lines tab
of a quotation template form. Doing so reveals a blank field in the Product
column.

When clicked, a drop-down menu with existing products in the database appear.
Select the desired product from the drop-down menu to add it to the quotation
template.

Tip

If the desired product isn‚Äôt readily visible, type the name of the desired
product in the Product field, and the option appears in the drop-down menu.
Products can also be found by clicking Search More‚Ä¶ from the drop-down menu.

Note

When a product is added to a quotation template, the default Quantity is `1`,
but that can be edited at any time.

Then, drag-and-drop the product to the desired position, via the six squares
icon, located to the left of each line item.

To add a _section_ , which serves as a header to organize the lines of a sales
order, click Add a section in the Lines tab. When clicked, a blank field
appears, in which the desired name of the section can be typed. When the name
has been entered, click away to secure the section name.

Then, drag-and-drop the section name to the desired position, via the six
squares icon, located to the left of each line item.

To add a note, which would appear as a piece of text for the customer on the
quotation, click Add a note in the Lines tab. When clicked, a blank field
appears, in which the desired note can be typed. When the note has been
entered, click away to secure the note.

Then, drag-and-drop the note to the desired position, via the six squares
icon.

To delete any line item from the Lines tab (product, section, and/or note),
click the üóëÔ∏è (trash can) icon on the far-right side of the line.

### Optional Products tab

The use of _optional products_ is a marketing strategy that involves the
cross-selling of products along with a core product. The aim is to offer
useful and related products to customers, which may result in an increased
sale.

For instance, if a customer wants to buy a car, they have the choice to order
massaging seats, as well, or ignore the offer and simply buy the car.
Presenting the choice to purchase optional products enhances the customer
experience.

Optional products appear as a section on the bottom of sales orders and
eCommerce pages. Customers can immediately add them to their online sales
orders themselves, if desired.

![Optional products appearing on a typical sales order with Odoo
Sales.](../../../../_images/optional-products-on-sales-order.png)

In the Optional Products tab, Add a line for each cross-selling product
related to the original items in the Lines tab, if applicable. The products
added here ideally complement the original offering as added value for the
prospective buyer.

![Populated optional products tab on a quotation template in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../_images/optional-products-tab-quotation-template1.png)

Clicking Add a line reveals a blank field in the Product column.

When clicked, a drop-down menu with products from the database appear. Select
the desired product from the drop-down menu to add it as an optional product
to the quotation template.

To delete any line item from the Optional Products tab, click the üóëÔ∏è (trash
can) icon.

Note

Optional products are **not** required to create a quotation template.

### Terms & Conditions tab

The Terms & Conditions tab provides the opportunity to add terms and
conditions to the quotation template. To add terms and conditions, simply type
(or copy/paste) the desired terms and conditions in this tab.

Sales.](../../../../_images/terms-and-conditions-tab.png)

(T&C)](../../../finance/accounting/customer_invoices/terms_conditions.html)

Note

Terms and conditions are **not** required to create a quotation template.

## Design quotation templates

In the upper-left corner of the quotation template form, there‚Äôs a Design
Template button.

![Design template button in the upper-left corner of quotation template
form.](../../../../_images/design-template-button.png)

When clicked, Odoo reveals a preview of the quotation template, through the
Odoo _Website_ application, as it will appear on the front-end of the website
to the customer.

Note

This feature is **only** available if the _Website_ application is installed.

Odoo uses numerous blue placeholder blocks to signify where certain elements
appear, and what they contain (e.g. Template Header, Product).

To edit the content, appearance, and overall design of the quotation template
via the _Website_ application, click the Edit button in the upper-right
corner.

![Design template edit button in the upper-right corner of quotation template
design.](../../../../_images/design-template-edit-button.png)

When Edit is clicked, Odoo reveals a sidebar filled with a variety of design
elements and feature-rich building blocks. These building blocks can be
dragged-and-dropped anywhere on the quotation template design.

![Design quotation template building blocks sidebar in Odoo
Website.](../../../../_images/design-quotation-building-blocks.png)

After a block has been dropped in the desired position, it can be customized
and configured to fit any unique need, look, or style.

Tip

Quotation template design uses the same methodology and functionality with
design building blocks as a typical web page design with Odoo _Website_. Be
sure to check out the [Website](../../../websites/website.html) documentation
to learn more.

When all blocks and customizations are complete, click the Save button to put
those configurations into place.

There is also a blue banner at the top of the quotation template design with a
link to quickly return Back to edit mode. When clicked, Odoo returns to the
quotation template form in the back-end of the _Sales_ application.

## Use quotation templates

When creating a quotation (Sales app ‚Ä£ New), choose a pre-configured template
in the Quotation Template field.

![Quotation templates field on a standard quotation form in Odoo
Sales.](../../../../_images/quotation-templates-field.png)

To view what the customer will see, click the Preview button at the top of the
page to see how the quotation template appears on the front-end of the website
through Odoo‚Äôs customer portal.
