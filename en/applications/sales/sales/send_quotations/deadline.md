# Quotation deadlines

In the Konvergo ERP _Sales_ application, it is possible to set deadlines on sales
quotations. Doing so encourages customers to act quickly during sales
negotiations, for they might fear for missing out on a good deal. As well,
deadlines also can also act as protection for a company in case an order has
to be fulfilled at a price that is no longer profitable for the business.

## Quotation expiration

In Konvergo ERP _Sales_ , there’s the option to add an expiration date to a quotation.

To add an expiration date to a quotation, navigate to Sales app, and select a
desired quotation, or create a new one by clicking **New**.

On the quotation form, click the **Expiration** field to reveal a pop-up
calendar. From this pop-up calendar, select the desired month and date as the
expiration date for the quotation.

## Quotation template expiration

The Konvergo ERP _Sales_ application also makes it possible to add a deadline
expiration date to quotation templates.

To add a deadline expiration date to a quotation template, navigate to Sales
app ‣ Configuration ‣ Quotation Templates, and either select the desired
quotation template to which a deadline should be added, or click **New** to
build a new quotation template from scratch.

On the quotation template form, add a specific number of days to the
**Quotation expires after** field, located beneath the quotation template
name. The number of days represents how long the quotation will be valid for,
before it expires.

Then, whenever that specific quotation template is used in a quote, an
expiration date is automatically calculated, based on the number of days
designated above. However, this date can be overwritten before sending the
quotation to the customer.
