# Close a subscription

Losing a customer is always difficult, especially if you put a lot of effort
into getting them to sign up for your products/services. However, many
companies come up with dubious methods to reduce the probability of this
happening.

**What is the right way to go?**

  1. If you adopt such methods, you are among companies that actively and indirectly spread the phobia of subscriptions, who do not think about how negatively dissatisfied customers could impact their business and, who frustrate the customers in a way or another. However, at some point, it is understandable that you do not want your customers to be involved in your subscription status.

  2. If you do not adopt such methods, you are among companies that continue to evolve in a long-term subscription business model, especially in an era of ultra-fast communications between dissatisfied customers, and who retain their customers by making it easier for them to leave if they want to. By giving them the opportunity to close their own subscriptions, your customers do not feel trapped because they subscribed to your products/services.

In summary, the **Konvergo ERP Subscriptions** application gives you the **possibility
to choose what you want to apply**. Indeed, you can decide whether to give
your customers the option to close their subscriptions whenever they want to
or to restrict this possibility. It depends on you and we will show you how to
do that in our amazing application.

## Configuration

Go to Subscriptions ‣ Configuration ‣ Subscription templates. From there, you
can create a new _Subscription template_ or modify an existing one. When
editing your template, underneath the Invoicing tab, you have the possibility
to activate the option _Closable by customer_. Once enabled, this option gives
your customers the right to close their own subscriptions.

## Close your first subscription

### Administrator view

Once confirmed, a quotation becomes a sales order and a new subscription is
automatically created. Therefore, this subscription has the status _In
progress_. From there, you have the possibility to close the subscription.

administrator.png)

By using the smart button _Close_ , you have to enter a close reason. For
example, “Subscription too expensive”, “Subscription does not meet my
requirements”, “Subscription reached its end date”, etc. Immediately after
confirming your close reason, you can observe that the status of the
subscription is now _Closed_ and that the close reason is mentioned on the
subscription.

### Customer view

As previously explained in the _Administrator view_ part, from the
subscription form, you also have the possibility to visualize what your
customers see when managing their subscriptions thanks to the _Customer
preview_ button. In this example, the customer has the choice to close his/her
subscription whenever he/she wants to, due to the _Close Subscription_ button.

By using this button, the customer can specify the reason for cancelling
his/her subscription and he/she can even leave a message.

By confirming the cancellation, the customer is redirected to his/her portal.
The administrator is informed of this modification. Indeed, the status of the
subscription becomes _Closed_ and a note appears in the chatter with the new
stage, the end date, the close reason, and the closing text added by the
customer.
