# Subscriptions

Odoo _Subscriptions_ is used to run recurring businesses: sell new contracts,
[upsell customers](subscriptions/upselling.html), keep the churn under
control, and [generate reports](subscriptions/reports.html) on the main KPIs:
MRR, ARR, retention, churn, etc.

## Subscription quotations

Important

Sales orders with a defined recurrence become subscriptions.

To create a new subscription, click on New from the _Subscription_ or the
[Sales](../sales.html) app. You can either:

  * Select a [subscription plan](subscriptions/plans.html) to prefill the quotation instantly, or

  * Fill out the quotation normally, making sure to select a recurrence and an end date if necessary and adding [recurrent products](subscriptions/products.html).

Tip

You can define different invoice and delivery addresses by enabling the
[Customer
Addresses](../finance/accounting/customer_invoices/customer_addresses.html)
feature.

## Confirmation

Send the quotation to the customer for confirmation by clicking on Send by
email, or confirm it immediately by clicking on Confirm.

Tip

Click on Customer Preview to preview the customer portal where the customer
can view their quotation, sign and pay it, and communicate with you.

## Automatic payments

You can require the customer to set an automatic payment method and pre-pay
the subscription’s first occurrence before they can confirm their quotation.
To do so, go to the Other Info tab of the quotation and check the Payment
option in the Online confirmation field.

If you leave Payment unchecked, the customer doesn’t have to pre-pay to start
the subscription. This means that the payment is not automatic and that the
customer must pay each invoice manually.

Important

If the online confirmation requires a pre-payment, your customer can select
only the [payment providers](../finance/payment_providers.html#payment-
providers-supported-providers) that have the [tokenization
feature](../finance/payment_providers.html#payment-providers-tokenization).
This ensures that the customer is automatically charged at each new period.
