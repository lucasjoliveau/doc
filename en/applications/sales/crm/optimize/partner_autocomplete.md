# Enrich contacts with partner autocomplete

_Partner autocomplete_ enriches the contacts database with corporate data. In
any module, enter the new company name into the **Customer** field
(`partner_id` technical field), and select one of the companies suggested in
the drop-down menu. Instantly get valuable company information full of hard-
to-find data for a desired company.

information about the business (including full business name and logo), social
media accounts, **Company type** , **Founded** information, **Sectors**
information, the number of **Employees** , **Estimated revenue** , **Phone**
number, **Timezone** , and **Technologies Used**.

## Enrich contacts with corporate data

From any module, as the user is typing in the name of a new company contact,
Konvergo ERP reveals a large drop-down menu of potential match suggestions. If any are
selected, the contact is then populated with corporate data related to that
specific selection.

For example, after typing `Konvergo ERP`, the following information populates:
