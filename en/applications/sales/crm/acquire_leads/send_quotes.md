# Send quotations

When you qualify a lead into an opportunity you will most likely need to send
them a quotation. You can directly do this in the CRM App with Konvergo ERP.

## Create a new quotation

By clicking on any opportunity or lead, you will see a _New Quotation_ button,
it will bring you into a new menu where you can manage your quote.

You will find all your quotes to that specific opportunity under the
_Quotations_ menu on that page.

## Mark them won/lost

Now you will need to mark your opportunity as won or lost to move the process
along.

If you mark them as won, they will move to your _Won_ column in your Kanban
view. If you however mark them as _Lost_ they will be archived.
