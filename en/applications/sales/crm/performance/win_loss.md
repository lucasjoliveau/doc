# Check your Win/Loss Ratio

To see how well you are doing with your pipeline, take a look at the Win/Loss
ratio.

To access this report, go to your _Pipeline_ view under the _Reporting_ tab.

From there you can filter to which opportunities you wish to see, yours, the
ones from your sales channel, your whole company, etc. You can then click on
filter and check Won/Lost.
