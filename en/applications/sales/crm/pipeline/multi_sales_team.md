# Multiple sales teams

Use the _Sales Teams_ feature to manage several sales teams, departments, or
channels, each with their own unique sales processes.

## Create a new sales team

To create a new sales team, go to CRM ‣ Configuration ‣ Sales Teams, then
click **Create**.

On the creation page, set an **Email Alias** to automatically generate a
lead/opportunity for this sales team every time a message is sent to that
unique email address. Choose whether to accept emails from **Everyone** ,
**Authenticated Partners** , or **Followers Only**.

Set an **Invoicing Target** if this team has specific monthly revenue goals.
Set a **Domain** to assign leads/opportunities to this sales team based on
specific filters, such as country, language, or campaign.

### Add members to a sales team

To add team members, click **Add** under the **Members** tab when editing the
sales team’s configuration page. Select a salesperson from the drop-down menu
or create new salesperson. Set a maximum number of leads that can be assigned
to this salesperson in a 30-day period to ensure that they do not overwork.

One person can be added as a team member or **Team Leader** to multiple sales
teams, allowing them to access all of the pipelines that they need to.

## Sales team dashboard

To view the sales team dashboard, go to CRM ‣ Sales ‣ Teams. Konvergo ERP users will
see any teams that they are a part of as dashboard tiles.

Each tile gives an overview of the sales team’s open opportunities,
quotations, sales orders, and expected revenue, as well as a bar graph of new
opportunities per week and an invoicing progress bar.

Click on the three dots in the corner of a tile to open a navigational menu
that lets users quickly view documents or reports, create new quotations or
opportunities, pick a color for this team, or access the team’s configuration
page.
