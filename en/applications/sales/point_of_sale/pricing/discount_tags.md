# Discount tags (barcode scanner)

If you want to sell your products with a discount, for a product getting close
to its expiration date for example, you can use discount tags. They allow you
to scan discount barcodes.

## Barcode Nomenclature

To use discounts tags, we need to learn about barcode nomenclature.

Let’s say you want to have a discount for the product with the following
barcode:

You can find the _Default Nomenclature_ under the settings of your PoS
interface.

Let’s say you want 50% discount on a product you have to start your barcode
with 22 (for the discount barcode nomenclature) and then 50 (for the %) before
adding the product barcode. In our example, the barcode would be:

## Scan the products & tags

You first have to scan the desired product (in our case, a lemon).
