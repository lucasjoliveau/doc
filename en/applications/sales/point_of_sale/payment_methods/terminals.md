# Payment terminals

Connecting and integrating a payment terminal with your POS system allows you
to accept multiple payment options, including credit and debit cards, making
the payment process more efficient.

## Configuration

Go to the [application settings](../configuration.html#configuration-
settings), scroll down to the Payment Terminals section, and tick your
terminalâ€™s checkbox.
