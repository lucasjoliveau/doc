# Restaurant features

Managing a restaurant or a bar comes with specific needs. The Point of Sale
application provides various features that allow performing all the required
tasks in such businesses.

Once the POS is set to be used in a restaurant or a bar, you can:

  * [organize your floors and tables to reflect your interior](restaurant/floors_tables.html);

  * [take orders](restaurant/floors_tables.html#floors-tables-orders);

  * [communicate with the kitchen or the bar through the POS](restaurant/kitchen_printing.html);

  * [print bills in advance and split them](restaurant/bill_printing.html);

  * [collect tips](restaurant/tips.html); and

  * [set different taxes for takeaway food](pricing/fiscal_position.html).

## Configuration

To enable the restaurant and bar-specific features, go to Point of Sale ‣
Configuration ‣ Settings, select the POS, and activate Is a Bar/Restaurant.

These features are displayed in the Restaurant & Bar section.
