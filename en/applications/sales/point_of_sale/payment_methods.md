# Payment methods

To add a payment method, you first need to create it. Go to Point of Sale ‣
Configuration ‣ Payment Methods ‣ New, and set a name. Check Identify Customer
to allow this payment method _exclusively_ for registered customers.

Then, select the Journal. Choose Cash to use this payment method for cash
payments, or Bank to use it for card payments.

Note

Selecting a bank journal automatically adds the Use a Payment Terminal field
in which you can add your [payment terminal’s
information](payment_methods/terminals.html).

Once the payment method is created, you can select it in your POS settings. To
do so, go to the [POS’ settings](configuration.html#configuration-settings),
click Edit, and add the payment method under the Payments section.
