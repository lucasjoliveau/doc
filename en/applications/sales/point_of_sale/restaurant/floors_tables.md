Note

To make your table easier to be found, you can rename them, change their
shape, size or even color. It is also possible to add the maximum number of
sits the table can have.

## Register your table(s) orders

To register an order, click on the respective table. By doing so, you are
taken to your main interface.

## Transfer customer(s)

If your customers want to move to another table after they already ordered,
use the transfer button. This way, the order is also moved to the new table.

To do so, select the table your customer is currently on.
