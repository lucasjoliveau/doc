# Bills

Typical practices in restaurants or bars are to request the bill before
proceeding to payment or splitting it based on the items ordered. Konvergo ERP POS
provides two features to perform these tasks seamlessly: **Bill Printing** and
**Bill Splitting**.

## Configuration

To activate the features, go to Point of Sale ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings,
select the POS, and activate **Early Receipt Printing** and **Allow Bill
Splitting** in the **Restaurant & Bar** section.

## Bill printing

From an open session, click Bill ‣ Print at any moment to generate and print a
bill.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The printed bill is <b>not</b> final and will be updated to reflect any changes to the order.</p>
</div>

## Bill splitting

From an open session, click **Split** to select the items to regroup. Once
everything is selected, click **Payment** and proceed to checkout for these
items. Repeat for each guest.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><ul>
<li><p>Once you return to the table, the selected items are no longer on order, as they have been paid
for.</p></li>
<li><p>The feature is available as soon as at least two items are ordered.</p></li>
</ul>
