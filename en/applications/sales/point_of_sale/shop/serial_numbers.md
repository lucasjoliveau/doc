# Serial numbers and lots

Working with **serial numbers** and **lots** allows tracking your products’
movements. When products are tracked, the system identifies their location
based on their last movement.

To enable traceability, go to Point of Sale ‣ Products ‣ Products. Then,
select a product and check the **Tracking By Unique Serial Number** or the
**Tracking By Lots** box in the **Inventory** tab.

## Serial numbers and lots importation

You can import serial numbers in Point of Sale. To do so, select a **sales
order** or a **quotation** containing tracked products. Then, agree to load
the **Lots or Serial Numbers** linked to the SO.

The imported tracking numbers appear below the tracked products. You can
modify them by clicking on the list-view button next to the products.

## Serial numbers and lots creation

If a tracked product is available in your POS, adding the product to the cart
opens a pop-up window where you can type or scan the product’s serial or lot
numbers. To add more than one of the same tracked products, click on **enter**
to validate and start a new line.
