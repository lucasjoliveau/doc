# Barcodes

Using a barcode scanner to process point-of-sale orders improves your
efficiency in providing quicker customer service. Barcode scanners can be used
both to scan products or to log employees into a POS session.

## Configuration

To use a barcode scanner, you must enable the feature in the Inventory app. Go
to Inventory ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, in the Barcode section, tick Barcode
Scanner and save.

Once enabled in **Inventory** , you can use the barcode feature in **Point of
Sale** with products that have a barcode number assigned.

## Assign barcodes

### To your products

To use this feature in POS, your products must have barcodes assigned. To do
so, go to Point of Sale ‣ Products ‣ Products and open a **product form**. Add
a barcode number in the Barcode field in the General Information tab.

### To your employees

To add an identification number to an employee, go to the **Employees** app
and open an **employee form**. Choose an identification number for your
employee and fill in the PIN Code field in the HR Settings tab.

## Use barcodes

### Scan products

Scan a product’s barcode using a barcode scanner. Doing so adds it directly to
the cart. To change the quantity, scan a product as many times as needed, or
click Qty and enter the number of products using the keypad.

You can also enter the barcode number manually in the search bar to look for
the product. Then, click it to add it to the cart.

### Log employees

You can also use a barcode scanner to log your employees. To do so, [restrict
