# Sales orders

When working in retail, you might need to order products directly from your
Point of sale. Fortunately, Konvergo ERP Point of Sale is fully integrated with Konvergo ERP
Sales, meaning that you can create a sales order and pay for it directly from
your point of sale.

## Select a sales order

From the **Point of Sale** application, open a new session. Then, click on
**Quotations/Orders** to get the complete list of quotations and sales orders
created on the sales application.

Note</p><p>To ease finding the right sales order, you can filter that list on the <b>customer</b> or on the
<b>order reference</b>. You can also set the customer before clicking on
<b>Quotations/Orders</b> to reduce the list to one particular customer.</p>

## Apply a down payment or settle the order

From the list of sales order, select one to make a payment.

You can either:

  * Settle the order **partially** : after clicking on **Apply a down payment** , enter the percentage of down payment you want the customer to pay. Then, click on **ok** and proceed with the order.

  * Settle the order **completely** : click on **Settle the order** to pay for the total of the sales order.

Note</p><p>Once you settle a sales order, the applied down payment is automatically deducted from the total
amount.</p>
