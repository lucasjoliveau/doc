# Engineering change orders

Utilize _engineering change orders_ (_ECOs_) to track, implement, and revert
change versions made to products, and [bills of
materials](../../manufacturing/management/bill_configuration#manufacturing-
management-bill-configuration).

Engineering change orders can be created:

  1. directly in the ECO type.

  2. by an operator in the tablet view of an operation.

  3. automatically from feedback submitted to the [ECO type‚Äôs email alias](eco_type#plm-eco-eco-type).

## Create ECO

To create a new ECO, begin by navigating to the _PLM_ app. Then, select the
ECO type card that will be used to track the progress of the change. On the
**Engineering Change Orders** page, click the **New** button in the top-left
corner.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Learn how to create new <a href="eco_type#plm-eco-eco-type"><span class="std std-ref">ECO types</span></a> to categorize and organize change
orders. Doing so ensures employees only view the <abbr title="Engineering Change Orders">ECOs</abbr> related to their responsibilities,
whether it involves new product introductions, targeted product line updates, or regulatory
compliance fulfillment.</p>
</div>

On the ECO form, fill in the following fields accordingly:

  * **Description** is a brief summary of the improvement.

  * **Type** : specifies the ECO type project for organizing the ECOs.

  * **Apply on** determines if the ECO changes the **Bill of Materials** or the **Product Only**.

  * **Product** indicates the product being improved.

  * **Bill of Materials** specifies the changed BoM. It auto-populates if the product in **Product** field has an existing BoM. If multiple BoMs exist, select the intended radio options from the drop-down menu.

  * **Company** field is used in multi-company databases. Specify if the change applies to products in a specific company, or leave blank if the change applies to all companies.

  * **Responsible** represents the assignee in charge of this ECO. (Optional)

  * **Effective** specifies when the ECO becomes live. Choosing **As soon as possible** means the ECO applies to the production BoM as soon as an authorized user applies the changes.

On the other hand, choosing **At Date** , and setting a specific date, leaves
a date that makes it easier to track the version history of the BoM, and the
specific date BoMs, used for production.

  * **Tags** are assigned to ECOs for prioritization and organization. Create a new tag by typing the name in the field and selecting **Create** from the drop-down menu. (Optional)

After filling out the ECO form, click the **Start Revision** button to begin
implementing the changes.

By pressing **Start Revision** , three actions occur:

  1. The **Documents** smart button appears, storing relevant files of the BoM.

  2. A copy of the production BoM is stored in the newly-appeared **Revision** smart button of the ECO. The next available version number (e.g., `V2`, `V3`, ‚Ä¶) is also assigned to keep track of all BoM versions.

  3. The stages of the ECO **Type** are displayed in the top-right corner of the ECO.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <b>Revision</b> smart button is available <b>only</b> when the <b>Bill of
Materials</b> radio button is selected in the <b>Apply on</b> field, and the <b>Start
Revision</b> button has been pressed.</p>
</div> ![ECO with overview of stages in the top-right corner, and

## Change components

To modify the components in a BoM, click the **Revision** smart button on an
ECO to access the new version of the BoM. Konvergo ERP distinguishes the non-
production version of the BoM from the current version, by flagging the test
BoM with a large **Archived** tag.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>After clicking the <b>Start Revision</b> button for an <abbr title="Engineering Change Order">ECO</abbr> for the product, <code>[D_0045
Stool]</code>, make changes to the product‚Äôs <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BoM</abbr> by clicking the <b>Revision</b> smart button.
Doing so opens the archived <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BoM</abbr>, marked with a large red <b>Archived</b> flag.</p>
<img alt="Show the archived Bill of Materials." class="align-center" src="../../../../_images/archived-bom.png"/>
</div>

On the new BoM, in the **Components** tab, proceed to modify the components
list, by changing the **Quantity** of existing components, adding new
components using the **Add a line** button, and removing components with the
**üóëÔ∏è (trash)** icon.

<div class="alert alert-success" id="plm-eco-example-keyboard">
<p class="alert-title">

<img alt="Make changes to components by going to the new BoM with the *Revision* smart button." class="align-center" src="../../../../_images/version-2-bom.png"/>
</div>

### Compare changes

Once the changes are complete, navigate back to the ECO, by clicking `ECO00X`
in the breadcrumbs located in the top-left corner. On the ECO form, a new
**BoM Changes** tab displays the differences between the current BoM and the
new version.

Blue text indicates new components added to the revised BoM that are not in
the production BoM. Black text represents updates shared by both BoMs, while
red text indicates components removed in the revised BoM.

Changes and tests are encapsulated in the revised BoM, and do **not** affect
the BoM currently used in production. That is, until the changes are applied.

## Change operations

To modify the operations in a BoM, click the **Revision** smart button on an
ECO to access the archived, new version of the BoM.

In the new BoM version, switch to the **Operations** tab to view and edit BoM
operations. To make changes, select each operation, which opens the
corresponding **Open: Operations** pop-up window.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <b>Operations</b> tab is <em>not</em> available by default. To enable it, navigate to
Manufacturing app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings, and check the <b>Work
Orders</b> box.</p>
</div>

Make changes to any of the fields in the **Open: Operations** pop-up window,
then click **Save** once completed.

Create new operations by clicking the **Add a line** button, and remove new
operations by clicking the **Archive Operation** button.

### Compare changes

Once the changes are complete, navigate back to the ECO, by clicking `ECO00X`
in the breadcrumbs located in the top-left corner.

On the ECO form, a new **Operation Changes** tab displays the differences
between the current production BoM and the new version.

Blue text indicates new operations added to the revised BoM that do not yet
exist in the production BoM. Black text represents updates shared by both
BoMs, while red text indicates operations removed in the revised BoM.

Modifications to the BoM in an ECO will **not** affect the BoM used in
production. That is, until the changes are applied.

In the **Operation Changes** tab, each row of details, beneath the columns in
the table, reflect the following information:

  * **Operation** : Name of the operation that was modified.

  * **Step** : specifies the quality control point, visible when the operation includes detailed instructions.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>To check for instructions, click the operation line item in the <b>Operations</b> tab of a
<abbr title="Bill of Materials">BoM</abbr>. Then, in the <b>Open: Operations</b> pop-up window, look for the

</div>

  * **Step Type** details the type of quality control for further instructions in the operation.

  * **Type** corresponds with the colored text to specify how the revised BoM differs from the production BoM. Operation change types can be **Add** , **Remove** , or **Update**.

  * **Work Center** specifies the work center at which the operation is performed.

  * **Manual Duration Change** refers to the change in the **Default Duration** field in the **Open: Operations** pop-up window, which specifies the expected time for completing the operation.

<div class="alert alert-success">

</div>

## Apply changes

After verifying the changes, move the ECO to a [verification
stage](eco_type#plm-eco-stage-config), which are stages that require
approval before the revised changes can be applied to the production BoM.

Once the approvers accept the changes, the **Apply Changes** button becomes
available. Click this button, and the ECO is automatically moved to a closing
stage. The changes are applied, which archives the original production BoM,
and the revised BoM becomes the new production BoM.

### Verify changes

To ensure the changes are live, from the ECO where the **Apply Changes**
button was just pressed, return to the revised BoM by clicking the
**Revision** smart button.

On the revised BoM, the large red **Archived** flag is removed.

To further verify the changes, check the production BoM by going to
Manufacturing app ‚Ä£ Products ‚Ä£ Products and select the product.

Then, on the product form, click the **Bill of Materials** smart button, and
select the BoM from the list. In the **Miscellaneous** tab of the BoM, the
**Version** field is updated to match the version number shown on the
**Revision** smart button of the latest ECO.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">

## Create ECO from tablet view

Operators can directly suggest clearer operation instructions, while
performing manufacturing orders (MOs) in the _Manufacturing_ app.

To create ECOs in this manner, begin by navigating to Manufacturing app ‚Ä£
Operations ‚Ä£ Manufacturing Orders. Then, select the desired MO and switch to
the **Work Orders** tab. Then, click the **üì± (mobile phone)** icon for the
desired work order to open the _tablet view_ of the operation.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <b>Revision</b> smart button is available <b>only</b> when the <b>Bill of
Materials</b> radio button is selected in the <b>Apply on</b> field, and the <b>Start
Revision</b> button has been pressed.</p>
</div>0 ![Find the tablet icon for each operation, second from
the far right.](../../../../_images/tablet-icon.png)

Next, add an instructional step, by clicking the **‚ò∞ (three horizontal
lines)** icon in the tablet view of an operation. Doing so opens the **Menu**
of action items for a MO. Then, click the **Add a step** button.

![Open the *Add a Step* pop-up by clicking the three horizontal lines icon in
tablet view.](../../../../_images/additional-options-menu.png)

Clicking the button reveals an **Add a step** pop-up window, where the
proposed changes are submitted.

In the **Title** field, enter a short step description. Next, in the
**Instruction** text field, type the instructions of the step in greater
detail. Optionally, add an image to the **Document** field. Once completed,
finish by clicking the **Propose Change** button.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <b>Revision</b> smart button is available <b>only</b> when the <b>Bill of
Materials</b> radio button is selected in the <b>Apply on</b> field, and the <b>Start
Revision</b> button has been pressed.</p>
</div>1

Based on the inputs from the **Add a Step** pop-up window, an ECO is created
with the following information:

  1. **Description** is the name of the operation, followed by the MO number for reference.

  2. The ECO **Type** is automatically assigned to `BOM Changes`.

  3. **Product** and **Bill of Materials** fields are automatically populated, based on the BoM used in the MO.

  4. **Responsible** is the operator who submitted the feedback.

### View ECO

To review the proposed changes, navigate to the PLM app ‚Ä£ Overview. In the
`BOM Updates` ECO type card, the **X Engineering Changes** button represents
the amount of operational changes created from the tablet view.

Click on the **X Engineering Changes** button to open the kanban view of the
ECO type. To view the suggestion, select an ECO in the `New` stage.

On the ECO, view a summary of the proposed changes in the **Operation
Changes** tab. Click the **Revision** smart button to navigate to the revised
BoM and look into the proposed changes in greater detail.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">

On the [quality control
point](../../quality/quality_management/quality_control_points#quality-
quality-management-quality-control-points) form, ensure the following form
fields are accurately filled out to give detailed instructions for operators:

  * **Title** : rename to give a concise description of the new instruction.

  * **Control per** : using the drop-down menu, determine whether this instruction applies broadly for the **Product** , specifically for this **Operation** _only_ , or a particular **Quantity** of the product.

  * **Type** : categorizes the control point type. From the drop-down menu, select **Instructions** to detail an instruction for the worker. To receive input from the workers, select the **Take a Picture** , **Register Consumed Materials** , **Print Label** , or other [quality check options](../../quality/quality_management/quality_control_points#quality-quality-management-quality-control-points).
