# Quality checks

Quality checks are manual inspections conducted by employees, and are used to
ensure the quality of products. In Odoo, a quality check can be conducted for
a single product, or multiple products within the same inventory operation or
manufacturing order.

Using a Quality Control Point (QCP), it is possible to create quality checks
automatically at regular intervals. When quality checks are created by a QCP,
they appear on a manufacturing or inventory order, where the employee
processing the order will be prompted to complete them. For a full explanation
of how to create and configure a QCP, see the documentation on [quality
control points](quality_control_points.html#quality-quality-management-
quality-control-points).

While quality checks are most commonly created automatically by a QCP, it is
also possible to manually create a single quality check. Creating a check
manually is useful when an employee wants to schedule a quality check that
will only occur once, or register a quality check that they conduct
unprompted.

## Manual quality check

To manually create a single quality check, navigate to Quality ‣ Quality
Control ‣ Quality Checks, and click New. On the quality check form, begin by
selecting an option from the Control per drop-down menu:

  * Operation requests a check for an entire operation (ex. delivery order) and all products within it.

  * Product requests a check for every unit of a product that is part of an operation (ex. every unit of a product within a delivery order).

  * Quantity requests a check for every quantity of a product that is part of an operation (ex. one check for five units of a product within a delivery order). Selecting Quantity also causes a Lot/Serial drop-down field to appear, from which can be selected a specific lot or serial number that the quality check should be conducted for.

Next, select an inventory operation from the Picking drop-down menu or a
manufacturing order from the Production Order drop-down menu. This is
necessary because Odoo needs to know for which operation the quality check is
being conducted.

If the quality check should be assigned to a specific QCP, select it from the
Control Point drop-down menu. This is useful if the quality check is being
created manually, but should still be recognized as belonging to a specific
QCP.

Select a quality check type from the Type drop-down field:

  * Instructions provides specific instructions for how to conduct the quality check.

  * Take a Picture requires a picture to be attached to the check before the check can be completed.

  * Pass - Fail is used when the product being checked must meet a certain criteria to pass the check.

  * Selecting Measure causes a Measure input field to appear, in which a measurement must be entered before the check can be completed.

  * Selecting Worksheet causes a Quality Template drop-down field to appear. Use it to select a quality worksheet that must be filled out to complete the check.

In the Team field, select the quality team that is responsible for the quality
check. In the Company field, select the company that owns the product being
inspected.

On the Notes tab at the bottom of the form, enter any relevant instructions in
the Instructions text entry box (ex. ‘Attach a picture of the product’). In
the Notes text entry box, enter any relevant information about the quality
check (who created it, why it was created, etc.).

Finally, if the check is being processed immediately, click the Pass button at
the top left of the screen if the check passes, or the Fail button if the
check fails.

## Process quality check

Quality checks can be processed directly on the quality check’s page, or from
a manufacturing or inventory order for which a check is required.
Alternatively, if a quality check is created for a specific work order
operation, the check is processed in the tablet view for the work order.

Note

It is not possible to manually create a single quality check that is assigned
to a specific work order operation. Quality checks for work order operations
can only be created by a QCP. See the documentation on [Quality Control
Points](quality_control_points.html#quality-quality-management-quality-
control-points) for information about how to configure a QCP that will create
quality checks for a specific work order operation.

### Quality check page

To process a quality check from the check’s page, begin by navigating to
Quality ‣ Quality Control ‣ Quality Checks, then select the check to process.
Follow the instructions for how to complete the check, listed in the
Instructions field of the Notes tab at the bottom of the page.

If the quality check passes, click the Pass button at the top of the page. If
the check fails, click the Fail button, instead.

### Quality check on order

To process a quality check on an order, select a manufacturing or inventory
order (receipt, delivery, return, etc.), for which a check is required.
Manufacturing orders can be selected by navigating to Manufacturing ‣
Operations ‣ Manufacturing Orders, and clicking on an order. Inventory orders
can be selected by navigating to Inventory, clicking the # To Process button
on an operation card, and selecting an order.

On the selected inventory or manufacturing order, a purple Quality Checks
button appears at the top of the order. Click the button to open the Quality
Check pop-up window, which shows all of the quality checks required for that
order.

Follow the instructions that appear on the Quality Check pop-up window. If a
Pass - Fail check is being processed, complete the check by clicking Pass or
Fail at the bottom of the pop-up window. For all other quality check types, a
Validate button appears instead. Click it to complete the check.

### Quality check on work order

To process a quality check for a work order, begin by navigating to
Manufacturing ‣ Operations ‣ Manufacturing Orders, then select a manufacturing
order. Select the Work Orders tab, then click the 📱 (tablet) tablet view
button for the work order that requires the quality check.

With tablet view open, complete the steps listed on the left side of the
screen until the quality check step is reached, then follow the instructions
at the top of the screen. If a Pass - Fail check is being processed, complete
the check by clicking Pass or Fail at the top of the screen. For all other
quality check types, a Next button appears instead. Click it to complete the
check and move on to the next step of the work order.
