# Quality checks

Quality checks are manual inspections conducted by employees, and are used to
ensure the quality of products. In Konvergo ERP, a quality check can be conducted for
a single product, or multiple products within the same inventory operation or
manufacturing order.

Using a Quality Control Point (QCP), it is possible to create quality checks
automatically at regular intervals. When quality checks are created by a QCP,
they appear on a manufacturing or inventory order, where the employee
processing the order will be prompted to complete them. For a full explanation
of how to create and configure a QCP, see the documentation on [quality
control points](quality_control_points#quality-quality-management-
quality-control-points).

While quality checks are most commonly created automatically by a QCP, it is
also possible to manually create a single quality check. Creating a check
manually is useful when an employee wants to schedule a quality check that
will only occur once, or register a quality check that they conduct
unprompted.

## Manual quality check

To manually create a single quality check, navigate to Quality â€£ Quality
Control â€£ Quality Checks, and click **New**. On the quality check form, begin
by selecting an option from the **Control per** drop-down menu:

  * **Operation** requests a check for an entire operation (ex. delivery order) and all products within it.

  * **Product** requests a check for every unit of a product that is part of an operation (ex. every unit of a product within a delivery order).

  * **Quantity** requests a check for every quantity of a product that is part of an operation (ex. one check for five units of a product within a delivery order). Selecting **Quantity** also causes a **Lot/Serial** drop-down field to appear, from which can be selected a specific lot or serial number that the quality check should be conducted for.

Next, select an inventory operation from the **Picking** drop-down menu or a
manufacturing order from the **Production Order** drop-down menu. This is
necessary because Konvergo ERP needs to know for which operation the quality check is
being conducted.

If the quality check should be assigned to a specific QCP, select it from the
**Control Point** drop-down menu. This is useful if the quality check is being
created manually, but should still be recognized as belonging to a specific
QCP.

Select a quality check type from the **Type** drop-down field:

  * **Instructions** provides specific instructions for how to conduct the quality check.

  * **Take a Picture** requires a picture to be attached to the check before the check can be completed.

  * **Pass - Fail** is used when the product being checked must meet a certain criteria to pass the check.

  * Selecting **Measure** causes a **Measure** input field to appear, in which a measurement must be entered before the check can be completed.

  * Selecting **Worksheet** causes a **Quality Template** drop-down field to appear. Use it to select a quality worksheet that must be filled out to complete the check.

In the **Team** field, select the quality team that is responsible for the
quality check. In the **Company** field, select the company that owns the
product being inspected.

On the **Notes** tab at the bottom of the form, enter any relevant
instructions in the **Instructions** text entry box (ex. â€˜Attach a picture of
the productâ€™). In the **Notes** text entry box, enter any relevant information
about the quality check (who created it, why it was created, etc.).

Finally, if the check is being processed immediately, click the **Pass**
button at the top left of the screen if the check passes, or the **Fail**
button if the check fails.

## Process quality check

Quality checks can be processed directly on the quality checkâ€™s page, or from
a manufacturing or inventory order for which a check is required.
Alternatively, if a quality check is created for a specific work order
operation, the check is processed in the tablet view for the work order.

<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>It is not possible to manually create a single quality check that is assigned to a specific work

### Quality check page

To process a quality check from the checkâ€™s page, begin by navigating to
Quality â€£ Quality Control â€£ Quality Checks, then select the check to process.
Follow the instructions for how to complete the check, listed in the
**Instructions** field of the **Notes** tab at the bottom of the page.

If the quality check passes, click the **Pass** button at the top of the page.
If the check fails, click the **Fail** button, instead.

### Quality check on order

To process a quality check on an order, select a manufacturing or inventory
order (receipt, delivery, return, etc.), for which a check is required.
Manufacturing orders can be selected by navigating to Manufacturing â€£
Operations â€£ Manufacturing Orders, and clicking on an order. Inventory orders
can be selected by navigating to Inventory, clicking the **# To Process**
button on an operation card, and selecting an order.

On the selected inventory or manufacturing order, a purple **Quality Checks**
button appears at the top of the order. Click the button to open the **Quality
Check** pop-up window, which shows all of the quality checks required for that
order.

Follow the instructions that appear on the **Quality Check** pop-up window. If
a Pass - Fail check is being processed, complete the check by clicking
**Pass** or **Fail** at the bottom of the pop-up window. For all other quality
check types, a **Validate** button appears instead. Click it to complete the
check.

### Quality check on work order

To process a quality check for a work order, begin by navigating to
Manufacturing â€£ Operations â€£ Manufacturing Orders, then select a manufacturing
order. Select the **Work Orders** tab, then click the **ðŸ“± (tablet)** tablet
view button for the work order that requires the quality check.

With tablet view open, complete the steps listed on the left side of the
screen until the quality check step is reached, then follow the instructions
at the top of the screen. If a Pass - Fail check is being processed, complete
the check by clicking **Pass** or **Fail** at the top of the screen. For all
other quality check types, a **Next** button appears instead. Click it to
complete the check and move on to the next step of the work order.
