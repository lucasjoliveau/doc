# Create quality alerts

Configuring quality control points is a great way to ensure that quality
checks are performed at routine stages during specific operations. However,
quality issues can often appear outside of these scheduled checks. Using Konvergo ERP
_Quality_ , users can create quality alerts for issues that are not detected
by automated processes.

</div>

## Find and fill out the quality alerts form

In some situations, it is necessary to manually create quality alerts within
the _Quality_ module.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>A helpdesk user who is notified of a product defect by a customer ticket can create an alert that
brings the issue to the attention of the relevant quality team.</p>
</div>

To create a new quality alert, start from the Quality module and select
Quality Control ‣ Quality Alerts ‣ Create. The quality alert form can then be
filled out as follows:

  * **Title** : choose a concise, yet descriptive title for the quality alert

  * **Product** : the product about which the quality alert is being created

  * **Product Variant** : the specific variant of the product that has the quality issue, if applicable

  * **Lot** : the lot number assigned to the product

  * **Work Center** : the work center where the quality issue originated

  * **Picking** : the picking operation during which the quality issue originated

  * **Team** : the quality team that will be notified by the quality alert

  * **Responsible** : the individual responsible for managing the quality alert

  * **Tags** : classify the quality alert based on user-created tags

  * **Root Cause** : the cause of the quality issue, if known

  * **Priority** : assign a priority between one and three stars to ensure more urgent issues are prioritized

The tabs at the bottom of the form can be used to provide additional
information to quality teams:

  * **Description** : provide additional details about the quality issue

  * **Corrective Actions** : the method for fixing affected products

  * **Preventive Actions** : procedures for preventing the issue from occurring in the future

  * **Miscellaneous** : the product vendor (if applicable), the company that produces the product, and the date assigned

## Add quality alerts during the manufacturing process

Konvergo ERP enables manufacturing employees to create quality alerts within a work
order without accessing the _Quality_ module. From the work order tablet view,
click the :guilabel:` ☰ ` hamburger menu icon in the top left corner and
select **Quality Alert**.

menu-button.png)

The quality alert form can then be filled out as detailed in the previous
section. After saving the form, a new alert will appear on the **Quality
Alerts** dashboard that can be found through the Quality ‣ Quality Control
menu.

## Manage existing quality alerts

By default, quality alerts are organized in a kanban board view. The stages of
the kanban board are fully configurable and alerts can be moved from one stage
to the next by dragging and dropping or from within each alert. Additional
options are available for viewing alerts, including graph, calendar, and pivot
table views.

grouped by quality team, root cause, or other parameters found under the <b>Filters</b>
button menu.</p>
