# Manufacturing backorders

In some cases, the full quantity of a manufacturing order cannot be produced
immediately. When this happens, Konvergo ERP _Manufacturing_ allows for the
manufacturing of partial quantities of the order and creates a _backorder_ for
the remaining amount.

In the _Manufacturing_ app, creating a backorder splits the original
manufacturing order into two orders. The reference tag for each order is the
tag used for the original order, followed by a hyphen and then an additional
number to indicate that it‚Äôs a backorder.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>A company creates a manufacturing order with the reference tag <em>WH/MO/00175</em>, for 10 units of
<em>Product X</em>. After starting work on the manufacturing order, the employee working the production
line realizes there are only enough components in stock to produce five units of the product.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting for additional stock of the components, they manufacture five units and create
a backorder for the remaining five. This splits the manufacturing order into two separate orders:
<em>WH/MO/00175-001</em> and <em>WH/MO/00175-002</em>.</p>
<p>Order <em>001</em> contains the five units that have been manufactured, and is immediately marked as
<b>Done</b>. Order <em>002</em> contains the five units that still need to be manufactured and is
marked as <b>In Progress</b>. Once the remaining components are available, the employee
returns to order <em>002</em> and manufactures the remaining units before closing the order.</p>

## Create a manufacturing backorder

To create a backorder for part of a manufacturing order, begin by navigating
to Manufacturing ‚Ä£ Operations ‚Ä£ Manufacturing Orders. Select a manufacturing
order with a quantity of two or more or create one by clicking **Create**.

If a new manufacturing order is created, select a product from the **Product**
drop-down menu and enter a quantity of two or more in the **Quantity** field,
then click **Confirm** to confirm the order.

After manufacturing the quantity that is being produced immediately, enter
that number in the **Quantity** field at the top of the manufacturing order.

field.png)

Next, click **Validate** , and a **You produced less than initial demand**
pop-up window appears, from which a backorder can be created. Click **Create
Backorder** to split the manufacturing order into two separate orders, with
the reference tags _WH/MO/XXXXX-001_ and _WH/MO/XXXXX-002_.

![The Create Backorder button on the "You produced less than initial demand"
pop-up window.](../../../../_images/create-backorder-button.png)

Order _001_ contains the items that have been manufactured, and is closed
immediately. Order _002_ is the backorder that contains the items that have
yet to be manufactured, and remains open, to be completed at a later date.

Once the remaining units can be manufactured, navigate to Manufacturing ‚Ä£
Operations ‚Ä£ Manufacturing Orders, and then select the backorder manufacturing
order. If all of the remaining units are manufactured immediately, simply
click **Validate** to close the order.

If only some of the remaining units are manufactured immediately, create
another backorder for the remainder by following the steps detailed in this
section.

## Create a backorder from tablet view

Backorders for manufacturing orders can also be created from the work order
tablet view.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>In order to use tablet view, the <em>Work Orders</em> setting must be enabled. To enable it, navigate to
Manufacturing ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings. On the <b>Settings</b> page,
enable the checkbox next to <b>Work Orders</b>, then click <b>Save</b> to save the
change. This makes the <b>Work Orders</b> tab appear on manufacturing orders, from which the
tablet view can be opened.</p>
<img alt="The Work Orders setting on the Manufacturing settings page." class="align-center" src="../../../../_images/work-orders-setting.png"/>
</div>

To create a backorder from the tablet view, begin by navigating to
Manufacturing ‚Ä£ Operations ‚Ä£ Manufacturing Orders. Select a manufacturing
order with a quantity of two or more or create one by clicking **Create**.

If a new manufacturing order is created, select a product from the **Product**
drop-down menu and enter a quantity of two or more in the **Quantity** field,
then click **Confirm** to confirm the order.

After confirming the manufacturing order, select the **Work Orders** tab and
click the **üì± (tablet view)** button located on the line of the first work
order to enter the tablet view.

![The tablet view button for a work order on a manufacturing
order.](../../../../_images/tablet-view-button.png)

Once in tablet view, enter the quantity being manufactured immediately in the
**Units** field at the top left of the tablet view.

![The Units field in the tablet view.](../../../../_images/units-field.png)

The steps for the rest of the workflow depend on whether the manufacturing
order being processed requires the completion of a single work order or
multiple work orders.

### Single work order

If the manufacturing order only requires the completion of a single work
order, complete the work order, then click **Mark As Done And Close MO**. The
manufacturing order is closed and a backorder for the units that still need to
be manufactured is created automatically.

![The Mark As Done And Close MO button in the tablet view of a work
order.](../../../../_images/madacmo-button.png)

Once the remaining units are ready to be manufactured, navigate to
Manufacturing ‚Ä£ Operations ‚Ä£ Manufacturing Orders, then select the backorder
manufacturing order, which is titled using the reference tag of the original
backorder with _002_ added to the end.

On the backorder manufacturing order, select the **Work Orders** tab and click
the **üì± (tablet view)** button located on the line of the work order to open
the tablet view. If all of the units in the backorder will be completed
immediately, simply click **Mark As Done And Close MO** after completing the
work order.

If only some of the remaining units will be manufactured immediately, enter
the number in the **Units** field at the top left of the tablet view, then
click **Mark As Done And Close MO** to create another backorder for the
remaining units. The new backorder can be processed using the steps detailed
in this section.

### Multiple work orders

If the manufacturing order requires the completion of multiple work orders,
complete the first work order, and then click **Record Production**. This
splits the manufacturing order into two separate orders, titled
_WH/MO/XXXXX-001_ and _WH/MO/XXXXX-002_ , with _XXXXX_ being the number of the
original order.

![The Record Production button on a work order.](../../../../_images/record-
production-button.png)

The tablet view defaults to showing the first work order for the _002_
manufacturing order. Since this manufacturing order will not be completed
immediately, back out of tablet view by clicking the **‚¨ÖÔ∏è (back)** button
twice. Doing so will take you to the _001_ order.

To finish the _001_ order, select the **Work Orders** tab and click the
**tablet view** button located on the line of the next work order. Finally,
complete the remaining work orders, then click **Mark As Done And Close MO**
to close the manufacturing order.

Once the remaining units are ready to be manufactured, navigate to
Manufacturing ‚Ä£ Operations ‚Ä£ Manufacturing Orders, then select the _002_
order. Select the **Work Orders** tab and click the **tablet view** button
located on the line of the first work order.

If all of the units in the backorder will be completed immediately, simply
click **Mark As Done And Close MO** after completing all of the work orders.

If only some of the remaining units will be manufactured immediately, enter
the number in the **Units** field at the top left of the tablet view, then
click **Record Production** to create an additional backorder for the
remaining units, with _003_ at the end of its reference tag.

The _002_ backorder and _003_ backorder can be completed by following the
steps detailed in this section.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>It is also possible to create a backorder in the middle of a manufacturing order, when some but
not all of the work orders have already been completed. Doing so marks the completed work
order(s) as <b>Finished</b> on the backorder.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>A manufacturing order for four chairs requires the completion of two work orders: <em>Paint</em> and
<em>Assemble</em>. While the paint step can be completed immediately for all four chairs, there are
only enough screws to assemble two of them.</p>
<p>As a result, the employee responsible for producing the chairs begins by painting all four,
and marking the <em>Paint</em> work order as <b>Finished</b> for all of them. Then, they move on
to the <em>Assemble</em> work order. They assemble two of the four chairs, enter that number in the
<b>Units</b> field of the tablet view, and click <b>Record Production</b>.</p>
<p>A backorder manufacturing order is created for the remaining two chairs. On the backorder, the
<em>Paint</em> work order is already marked as <b>Finished</b>, and only the <em>Assemble</em> work
order is left to be completed.</p>
<p>Once more screws are available, the manufacturing employee assembles the remaining chairs and
clicks <b>Mark As Done And Close MO</b> to complete the <em>Assemble</em> work order and close
the backorder manufacturing order.</p>
