# Scrap during manufacturing

During the manufacturing process, the need to scrap manufacturing components
or finished products may arise. This can be necessary if a component or
product is damaged, or unusable for any other reason.

By default, scrapping a component or finished product removes it from physical
inventory and places it in a virtual location titled _Virtual
Locations/Scrap_. A virtual location is **not** a physical space, but rather a
designation in Odoo that is used to track items that are no longer in physical
inventory.

Odoo _Manufacturing_ allows for both components and finished products to be
scrapped within a manufacturing order. The specific type of item that can be
scrapped during a manufacturing order depends on the stage of the
manufacturing process.

Tip

Scrap orders can be viewed by navigating to Inventory ‣ Operations ‣ Scrap.
Each scrap order shows the date and time the order was created, along with the
product and quantity that was scrapped.

To view the total quantity of each item scrapped, navigate to Inventory ‣
Configuration ‣ Locations, then remove the Internal filter from the Search…
bar to display all virtual locations. From the list, select the Virtual
Locations/Scrap location.

## Scrap manufacturing components

To scrap components during the manufacturing process, begin by navigating to
Manufacturing ‣ Manufacturing Orders, then select a manufacturing order or
click Create to configure a new one. If a new manufacturing order is created,
select a product from the Product drop-down menu, then click Confirm.

Once the manufacturing order has been confirmed, a Scrap button appears at the
top of the page. Click the button and a Scrap pop-up window appears.

From the Product drop-down menu on the Scrap pop-up window, select the
component that is being scrapped, then enter the quantity in the Quantity
field. Finally, click Done to scrap the component.

Important

Before clicking Mark As Done on a manufacturing order, only the components of
the finished product can be scrapped, **not** the finished product itself.
This is because Odoo recognizes that the finished product cannot be scrapped
before it has been manufactured.

After scrapping a component, continue the manufacturing process using the
required quantity of the component that was scrapped. The on-hand stock count
for the component that was scrapped updates to reflect both the scrapped
quantity and the quantity consumed during manufacturing.

Example

If the manufacturing of a table requires four units of a table leg, and two
units of the table leg were scrapped during the manufacturing process, the
total quantity of table legs consumed will be six: four units used to
manufacture the table plus two units scrapped.

## Scrap components from tablet view

Components can also be scrapped from the manufacturing tablet view. To do so,
select the Work Orders tab on a manufacturing order, then click the 📱 (tablet
view) icon for a work order.

icon.png)

With tablet view open, click the ☰ (menu) button at the top left of the
screen, then select the Scrap button on the Menu pop-up window. The Scrap pop-
up window then appears.

Finally, select a component from the Product drop-down menu and enter the
quantity being scrapped in the Quantity field. Click Done to scrap the
component.

## Scrap finished products

Odoo also allows for finished products to be scrapped from a manufacturing
order once the order is completed. After clicking Mark as Done, click the
Scrap button to make the Scrap pop-up window appear.

Since the components have been consumed to create the finished product, they
will no longer appear in the Product drop-down menu. Instead, the finished
product will be available as an option. Select the finished product and enter
the quantity to be scrapped in the Quantity field. Click Done to scrap the
finished product.

The on-hand stock count for the product that was scrapped will update to
reflect both the scrapped quantity and the quantity produced during
manufacturing.

Example

If five units of a chair were manufactured, but two units were scrapped after
manufacturing was completed, then the on-hand inventory of the chair will
increase by three: five units manufactured minus two units scrapped.
