# Scrap during manufacturing

During the manufacturing process, the need to scrap manufacturing components
or finished products may arise. This can be necessary if a component or
product is damaged, or unusable for any other reason.

By default, scrapping a component or finished product removes it from physical
inventory and places it in a virtual location titled _Virtual
Locations/Scrap_. A virtual location is **not** a physical space, but rather a
designation in Konvergo ERP that is used to track items that are no longer in physical
inventory.

Konvergo ERP _Manufacturing_ allows for both components and finished products to be
scrapped within a manufacturing order. The specific type of item that can be
scrapped during a manufacturing order depends on the stage of the
manufacturing process.

## Scrap manufacturing components

To scrap components during the manufacturing process, begin by navigating to
Manufacturing â€£ Manufacturing Orders, then select a manufacturing order or
click **Create** to configure a new one. If a new manufacturing order is
created, select a product from the **Product** drop-down menu, then click
**Confirm**.

Once the manufacturing order has been confirmed, a **Scrap** button appears at
the top of the page. Click the button and a **Scrap** pop-up window appears.

From the **Product** drop-down menu on the **Scrap** pop-up window, select the
component that is being scrapped, then enter the quantity in the **Quantity**
field. Finally, click **Done** to scrap the component.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>Before clicking <b>Mark As Done</b> on a manufacturing order, only the components of the
finished product can be scrapped, <b>not</b> the finished product itself. This is because Konvergo ERP
recognizes that the finished product cannot be scrapped before it has been manufactured.</p>
</div>

After scrapping a component, continue the manufacturing process using the
required quantity of the component that was scrapped. The on-hand stock count
for the component that was scrapped updates to reflect both the scrapped
quantity and the quantity consumed during manufacturing.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>If the manufacturing of a table requires four units of a table leg, and two units of the table
leg were scrapped during the manufacturing process, the total quantity of table legs consumed
will be six: four units used to manufacture the table plus two units scrapped.</p>
</div>

## Scrap components from tablet view

Components can also be scrapped from the manufacturing tablet view. To do so,
select the **Work Orders** tab on a manufacturing order, then click the **ðŸ“±
(tablet view)** icon for a work order.

icon.png)

With tablet view open, click the **â˜° (menu)** button at the top left of the
screen, then select the **Scrap** button on the **Menu** pop-up window. The
**Scrap** pop-up window then appears.

Finally, select a component from the **Product** drop-down menu and enter the
quantity being scrapped in the **Quantity** field. Click **Done** to scrap the
component.

## Scrap finished products

Konvergo ERP also allows for finished products to be scrapped from a manufacturing
order once the order is completed. After clicking **Mark as Done** , click the
**Scrap** button to make the **Scrap** pop-up window appear.

Since the components have been consumed to create the finished product, they
will no longer appear in the **Product** drop-down menu. Instead, the finished
product will be available as an option. Select the finished product and enter
the quantity to be scrapped in the **Quantity** field. Click **Done** to scrap
the finished product.

The on-hand stock count for the product that was scrapped will update to
reflect both the scrapped quantity and the quantity produced during
manufacturing.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>If five units of a chair were manufactured, but two units were scrapped after manufacturing was
completed, then the on-hand inventory of the chair will increase by three: five units
manufactured minus two units scrapped.</p>
</div>
