# Manage work orders using work centers

Konvergo ERP Manufacturing allows for work orders to be carried out at specific work
centers. When a manufacturing order is created for a product, any work orders
listed in the **Operations** tab of the product bill of materials (BoM) will
be automatically created as well and assigned to the specified work center.
Work orders can be managed in the **Manufacturing** module by selecting
Operations ‣ Work Orders.

In order to use work centers, the **Work Orders** feature must first be
enabled. To do so, go to the **Manufacturing** module, select Configuration ‣
Settings, and activate the checkbox next to **Work Orders**. Work centers can
then be created and managed by selecting Configuration ‣ Work Centers.

## Create a work center

Within the **Manufacturing** module, select Configuration ‣ Work Centers ‣
Create. The work center form can then be filled out as follows:

  * **Work Center Name** : give the work center a concise name that describes the type of operations it will be used for

  * **Alternative Workcenters** : specify an alternative work center for operations to be carried out at if the main work center is not available

  * **Code** : assign the work center a reference code

  * **Working Hours** : define the number of hours that the work center can be in use each week

  * **Company** : select the company that the work center belongs to

### Set standards for work center productivity

The **General Information** tab on the work center form allows for
productivity goals to be assigned to a work center:

  * **Time Efficiency** : used to calculate the expected duration of a work order at the work center; for example, if a work order normally takes one hour and the efficiency is set to 200%, the work order will take 30 minutes

  * **Capacity** : the number of operations that can be performed at the work center simultaneously

  * **OEE Target** : the target for efficiency at the work center

  * **Time before prod.** : setup time required before work can commence

  * **Time after prod.** : breakdown or cleanup time required after work is finished

  * **Cost per hour** : the cost of operating the work center for one hour

  * **Analytic Account** : the account where the cost of the work center should be recorded

form.](../../../../_images/work-center-general-information.png)

### Assign equipment to a work center

Using the **Equipment** tab, it is possible for specific pieces of equipment
to be assigned to a work center. The following information will be displayed
for each piece of equipment added:

  * **Equipment Name** : the name of the piece of equipment

  * **Technician** : the technician responsible for servicing the equipment

  * **Equipment Category** : the category the equipment belongs to

  * **MTBF** : mean time between failures; the average time that the piece of equipment will operate before failing

  * **MTTR** : mean time to recovery; the average time it takes for the equipment to become fully operational again

  * **Est. Next Failure** : an estimate of when the next equipment failure will occur

<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p><b>MTBF</b>, <b>MTTR</b>, and <b>Est. Next Failure</b> are all calculated
automatically based on past failure data, if any exists.</p>
</div>

### Integrate IoT devices

The **IoT Triggers** tab enables the integration of IoT devices with a work
center:

  * **Device** : specifies the IoT device to be triggered

  * **Key** : the security key for the device

  * **Action** : the IoT device action triggered

## Use case: configure an alternative work center

When a work center is at capacity, it cannot accept any new work orders.
Instead of waiting for the work center to become available, it is possible to
specify an alternative work center where surplus work orders should be carried
out.

Begin by creating a new work center. Configure the **Equipment** tab so that
it has all of the same equipment as the main work center. This will ensure
that the same tasks can be carried out at both work centers. Navigate to the
main work center and include the new work center in the **Alternative
Workcenters** selection field.

Now, create a new manufacturing order that uses the main work center for one
of its operations. The main work center will automatically be selected for the
operation in the **Work Orders** tab. After confirming the manufacturing
order, click the **Plan** button that appears at the top left of the form.

![Click the plan button to automatically select an available work
center.](../../../../_images/manufacturing-order-plan-button.png)

If the main work center is at capacity, the work center selected for the
operation will be automatically changed to the alternative work center.

## Monitor work center performance

Performance for an individual work center can be viewed by selecting
Configuration ‣ Work Centers, and clicking on a work center. A variety of
metrics showing work center performance can be viewed at the top right of the
form:

  * **OEE** : overall effective efficiency, the percentage of time that the work center has been fully productive

  * **Lost** : the amount of time lost due to work stoppages

  * **Load** : the amount of time it will take to complete the current workload

  * **Performance** : the real duration of work time, shown as a percentage of the expected duration
