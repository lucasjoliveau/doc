# Work order dependencies

When manufacturing certain products, specific operations may need to be
completed before others can begin. In order to ensure operations are carried
out in the correct order, Odoo _Manufacturing_ features a _work order
dependencies_ setting. Enabling this setting allows for operations on a Bill
of Materials (BoM) to be _blocked_ by other operations that should occur
first.

## Configuration

The _work order dependencies_ setting is not enabled by default. To enable it,
begin by navigating to Manufacturing ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings. Then, enable
the Work Orders setting, if it is not already active.

After enabling the Work Orders setting, the Work Order Dependencies setting
appears below it. Enable Work Order Dependencies, then click Save to confirm
the changes.

## Add dependencies to BoM

Work order dependencies are configured on a product’s BoM. To do so, navigate
to Manufacturing ‣ Products ‣ Bills of Materials, then select a BoM, or create
a new one by clicking New.

For a complete guide on how to properly configure a new BoM, see the
documentation on [creating a bill of
materials](bill_configuration.html#manufacturing-management-bill-
configuration).

On the BoM, click on the Miscellaneous tab, then enable the Operation
Dependencies checkbox. This makes a new Blocked By option available in the
settings of the Operations tab.

BoM.](../../../../_images/operation-dependencies.png)

Next, click on the Operations tab. On the top-right of the tab, click on the
tab’s settings button, then enable the Blocked By checkbox. This makes a
Blocked By field appear for each operation on the Operations tab.

BoM.](../../../../_images/operations-settings.png)

In the line of the operation that should be blocked by another operation,
click the Blocked By field, and an Open: Operations pop-up window appears. In
the Blocked By drop-down field on the pop-up window, select the blocking
operation that must be completed _before_ the operation that is blocked.

Finally, save the BoM by clicking Save.

## Plan work orders using dependencies

Once work order dependencies have been configured on a BoM, Odoo
_Manufacturing_ is able to plan when work orders are scheduled, based on their
dependencies. To plan the work orders for a manufacturing order, begin by
navigating to Manufacturing ‣ Operations ‣ Manufacturing Orders.

Next, select a manufacturing order for a product with work order dependencies
set on its BoM, or create a new manufacturing order by clicking New. If a new
manufacturing order is created, select a BoM configured with work order
dependencies from the Bill of Material drop-down field, then click Confirm.

After confirming the manufacturing order, select the Work Orders tab to view
the work orders required to complete it. Any work orders that are _not_
blocked by a different work order display a `Ready` tag in the Status section.

Work orders that are blocked by one or more work orders display a `Waiting for
another WO` tag instead. Once the blocking work order(s) are completed, the
tag updates to `Ready`.

order.](../../../../_images/work-order-status.png)

To schedule the manufacturing order’s work orders, click the Plan button at
the top of the page. After doing so, the Scheduled Start Date field for each
work order on the Work Orders tab auto-fills with the scheduled start date and
time. A blocked work order is scheduled at the end of the time period
specified in the Expected Duration field of the work order that precedes it.

Example

A manufacturing order is created for Product A. The manufacturing order has
two operations: Cut and Assemble. Each operation has an expected duration of
60 minutes, and the Assemble operation is blocked by the Cut operation.

The Plan button for the manufacturing order is clicked at 1:30 pm, and the Cut
operation is scheduled to begin immediately. Since the Cut operation has an
expected duration of 60 minutes, the Assemble operation is scheduled to begin
at 2:30 pm.

### Planning by workcenter

To see a visual representation of how work orders are planned, navigate to the
Work Orders Planning page by going to Manufacturing ‣ Planning ‣ Planning by
Workcenter. This page shows a timeline of all the work orders scheduled for
each operation.

If one work order is blocked by the completion of another, the work order that
is blocked is shown as scheduled to start after the work order blocking it. In
addition, an arrow connects the two work orders, leading from the blocking
operation to the blocked operation.
