# Process receipts and deliveries in one step

By default, incoming shipments are configured to be received directly into
stock, and outgoing shipments are configured to be delivered directly from
stock to the customer; the default setting for warehouses in Konvergo ERP is one step
receipts and deliveries.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Incoming and outgoing shipments do not need to be configured with the same steps. For example,
products can be received in one step, but shipped in three steps.</p>
</div>

In the following example, one step will be used for both receipts and
deliveries.

## Configure the warehouse

If another receiving or shipping configuration is set on the warehouse, they
can easily be set back to the one step setting.

Begin by navigating to Inventory ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Warehouses, and click on
the desired warehouse to edit. Next, on the **Warehouse Configuration** tab,
under the **Shipments** section, select **Receive goods directly (1 step)**
for **Incoming Shipments** and/or **Deliver goods directly (1 step)** for
**Outgoing Shipments**.
