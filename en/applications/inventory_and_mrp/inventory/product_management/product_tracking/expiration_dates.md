# Expiration dates

In Odoo, _expiration dates_ can be used to manage and track the lifecycles of
perishable products, from purchase to sale. Using expiration dates reduces
product loss due to unexpected expiry, and helps to avoid sending expired
products to customers.

In Odoo, only products that are tracked using _lots_ and _serial numbers_ can
be assigned expiration information. Once a lot or serial number has been
assigned, an expiration date can be set. This is especially helpful for
companies (such as food manufacturers) that consistently, or exclusively, buy
and sell perishable products.

## Enable expiration dates

To enable the use of _expiration dates_ , go to Inventory app ‣ Configuration
‣ Settings, and scroll down to the Traceability section. Then, click the
checkbox to enable the Lots & Serial Numbers feature.

Once that feature is activated, a new option will appear to enable Expiration
Dates. Click that checkbox to enable the feature, and be sure to Save changes.

settings.](../../../../../_images/expiration-dates-enabled-settings.png)

Tip

Once the Lots & Serial Numbers feature is activated, additional features
appear to Display Lots & Serial Numbers on Delivery Slips; to Display Lots &
Serial Numbers on Invoices; and to Display Expiration Dates on Delivery Slips.
Activating these features helps with end-to-end traceability, making it easier
to manage product recalls, identify “bad” batches of products, and more.

## Configure expiration dates on products

Once the Lots & Serial Numbers and Expiration Dates features have been enabled
in the settings of the _Inventory_ app, expiration information can be
configured on individual products.

To do so, go to Inventory app ‣ Products ‣ Products, and select a product to
edit. Selecting a product reveals the product form for that particular item.
Once on the product form, click Edit in the upper-left corner to make changes.

Important

To be tracked using lots or serial numbers, or to configure expiration
information, products _must_ have their Product Type set as Storable Product
under the General Information tab.

Then, click the Inventory tab, and scroll down to the Traceability section.
From here, make sure that either By Unique Serial Number or By Lots is
checked.

Once it is, a new Expiration Date checkbox appears that must also be clicked.
When both are enabled, a new Dates field appears to the right.

Note

If a product has stock on-hand prior to activating tracking by lots or serial
numbers, an inventory adjustment might need to be performed in order to assign
lot numbers to the existing stock.

Tip

For processing large quantities of products on receipts or deliveries, it is
recommended to track using lots, so multiple products can be traced back to
the same lot, if any issues arise.

![Expiration dates configuration on the product
form.](../../../../../_images/expiration-dates-product-configuration.png)

Under the Dates field, there are four categories of expiration information to
configure for the product:

  * Expiration Time: the number of days after receiving products (either from a vendor or in stock after production) in which goods may become dangerous and should not be used or consumed.

  * Best Before Time: the number of days before the expiration date in which the goods start deteriorating, **without** necessarily being dangerous yet.

  * Removal Time: the number of days before the expiration date in which the goods should be removed from stock.

  * Alert Time: the number of days before the expiration date in which an alert should be raised on goods in a particular lot or containing a particular serial number.

Note

The values entered into these fields automatically compute the expiration date
for goods entered into stock, whether purchased from a vendor or manufactured
in-house.

Once all the expiration information has been configured, click Save to save
all changes.

Tip

If the Dates field is not populated with any values for expiration
information, dates (and lots) can be manually assigned upon receipts and
deliveries in and out of the warehouse. Even when assigned, they can still be
overwritten and changed manually if needed, as well.

## Set expiration dates on receipts with lots & serial numbers

Generating expiration dates for **incoming** goods can be done directly from
the purchase order. To create a purchase order, go to the Purchase app and
click Create to create a new request for quotation (RFQ).

Then, fill out the information by adding a Vendor, and add products to the
Product lines by clicking Add a product.

Choose the desired quantity to order by changing the number in the Quantity
column, and click Confirm Order. This converts the RFQ into a purchase order.

Click the Receipt smart button at the top of the purchase order to be taken to
the warehouse receipt form.

Note

Clicking Validate before assigning a serial number to the ordered product
quantities causes a User Error popup to appear. The popup requires entry of a
lot or serial number for the ordered products. The RFQ cannot be validated
without an assigned lot or serial number.

![User error popup when validating an order with no lot
number.](../../../../../_images/expiration-dates-user-error-popup.png)

From here, click the Additional Options menu (hamburger) icon located on the
far-right of the product line. When clicked, a Detailed Operations pop-up will
appear.

In this pop-up, click Add a line, and assign a lot or serial number under the
Lot/Serial Number Name field.

An expiration date automatically populates, based on the configuration on the
product form (if previously configured).

Tip

If the Dates field on the product form has not been configured, this date can
be manually entered.

After the expiration date has been established, mark the Done quantities, and
click Confirm to close the pop-up. Finally, click Validate.

![Detailed operations popup showing expiration dates for ordered
products.](../../../../../_images/expiration-dates-detailed-operations-
popup.png)

A Traceability smart button will appear upon validating the receipt. Click the
Traceability smart button to see the updated Traceability Report, which
includes: a Reference document; the Product being traced; the Lot/Serial #;
and more.

## Set expiration dates on manufactured products

Expiration dates can also be generated for products manufactured in-house. To
assign expiration dates to manufactured products, a manufacturing order (MO)
needs to be completed.

To create a MO, go to Manufacturing app ‣ Operations ‣ Manufacturing Orders,
and click Create. Choose a product to manufacture from the Product field drop-
down menu, then select the Quantity to produce.

![Manufacturing order for product with expiration
date.](../../../../../_images/expiration-dates-manufacturing-order.png)

Note

To manufacture a product, there must be materials to consume in the lines in
the Product column. This can be achieved either by creating a Bill of Material
for the Product, or manually adding materials to consume by clicking Add a
line.

Once ready, click Confirm.

Next to Lot/Serial Number, either select an existing lot number from the drop-
down menu, or click the green + sign to automatically assign a new lot number.

Then, select a number of units for the Quantity field, and click Mark as Done.

Click on the External Link icon in the assigned Lot/Serial Number field. A
pop-up appears, revealing a detail form for that specific number.

On that pop-up, under the Dates tab, all expiration information that was
previously configured for the product is displayed. That same information is
also available on the detail form for that specific product, or by going to
Inventory app ‣ Products ‣ Lots/Serial Numbers.

number.](../../../../../_images/expiration-dates-dates-tab-lot-number.png)

## Sell products with expiration dates

Selling perishable products with expiration dates is done the same as any
other type of product. The first step in selling perishable products is to
create a sales order.

To do that, go to Sales app ‣ Create to create a new quotation, and fill out
the information on the sales order form.

Add a Customer, click Add a product to add the desired products to the Product
lines, and set a Quantity for the products.

Then, click the Other Info tab. Under the Delivery section, change the
Delivery Date to a date after the expected date, and click the green checkmark
icon to confirm the date. Finally, click Confirm to confirm the sales order.

Next, click the Delivery smart button at the top of the sales order to see the
warehouse receipt form.

On the warehouse receipt form, click Validate, and then Apply in the
accompanying pop-up window, to automatically process all Done quantities, and
deliver the products to the customer.

If the products are delivered before the Alert Date set on the product form,
then no alerts will be created.

Important

To sell perishable products with expiration dates, the Removal Strategy for
the Location the products are stored in must be set to FEFO. If there is not
enough stock of perishable products in one lot, Odoo will automatically take
the remaining quantity required from a second lot with the next-soonest
expiration date. Removal strategies can also be set on Product Categories.

FEFO)](../../warehouses_storage/advanced_operations_warehouse/removal.html)

## View expiration dates for lots & serial numbers

To view (and/or group) all products with expiration dates by lot number, go to
Inventory app ‣ Products ‣ Lots/Serial Numbers.

Once there, remove any default search filters from the Search… bar. Then,
click Group By, choose Add Custom Group, and select the Expiration Date
parameter from the drop-down menu. Finally, click Apply to apply the filter.

Doing so breaks down all perishable products, their expiration dates, and the
assigned lot number.

![Group by expiration dates on lots and serial numbers
page.](../../../../../_images/expiration-dates-group-by-dates.png)

### Expiration alerts

To see expiration alerts, go to Inventory app ‣ Products ‣ Lots/Serial
Numbers.

Then, click into a Lot/Serial Number with perishable products. Doing so
reveals the serial number detail form. On the serial number detail form, click
the Dates tab to see all expiration information related to the products.

To edit the form, click Edit in the upper-left corner of the form, then change
the Expiration Date to today’s date (or earlier), and click Save to save
changes.

After saving, the lot number form displays a red Expiration Alert at the top
of the form to indicate that the products in this lot are either expired or
expiring soon. From here, click back to the Lots/Serial Numbers page (via the
breadcrumbs).

To see the new expiration alert, or any expiration alerts for products that
are expired (or will expire soon), remove all of the search filters from the
Search… bar on the Lots/Serial Numbers dashboard.

Then, click Filters, and choose Expiration Alerts.
