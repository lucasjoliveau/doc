# Use serial numbers to track products

_Serial numbers_ are one of the two ways to identify and track products in
Konvergo ERP. A serial number is a unique identifier assigned incrementally (or
sequentially) to an item or product, used to distinguish it from other items
and products.

Serial numbers can consist of many different types of characters: they can be
strictly numerical, they can contain letters and other typographical symbols,
or they can be a mix of all of the above.

The goal of assigning serial numbers to individual products is to make sure
that every item’s history is identifiable when it travels through the supply
chain. This can be especially useful for manufacturers that provide after-
sales services to products that they sell and deliver.

## Enable lots & serial numbers

To track products using serial numbers, the **Lots & Serial Numbers** feature
must be enabled. To enable this, go to Inventory app ‣ Configuration ‣
Settings, scroll down to the **Traceability** section, and click the box next
to **Lots & Serial Numbers**. Remember to click the **Save** button to save
changes.

numbers-enabled-setting.png)

## Configure serial number tracking on products

Once the **Lots & Serial Numbers** setting has been activated, individual
products can now be tracked using serial numbers. To configure this, go to
Inventory app ‣ Products ‣ Products, and choose a desired product to track.

Once on the product form, click **Edit** , and click the **Inventory** tab.

Once on the product form, click **Edit** , navigate to the **Inventory** tab,
and scroll to the **Traceability** section. Then, select the **By Unique
Serial Number** option, and click **Save** to save the changes. Existing or
new serial numbers can now be selected and assigned to newly-received or
manufactured batches of this product.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>If a product doesn’t have a serial number assigned to it, a user error pop-up window will appear.
The error message states that the product(s) in stock have no lot/serial number. However, a
lot/serial number can be assigned to the product by making an inventory adjustment.</p>
</div>

### Create new serial numbers for products already in stock

New serial numbers can be created for products already in stock with no
assigned serial number. To do this, go to Inventory ‣ Products ‣ Lots/Serial
Numbers, and click **Create**. Doing so reveals a blank lots/serial numbers
form. On this form, a new **Lot/Serial Number** is generated automatically.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>While Konvergo ERP automatically generates a new lot/serial number to follow the most recent number, it
can be edited and changed to any desired number, by clicking the line under the
<b>Lot/Serial Number</b> field, and changing the generated number.</p>
</div>

Once the **Lot/Serial Number** is generated, click the blank field next to
**Product** to reveal a drop-down menu. From this menu, select the product to
which this new number will be assigned.

This form also provides the option to adjust the **Quantity** , to assign a
unique **Internal Reference** number (for traceability purposes), and to
assign this specific lot/serial number configuration to a specific website in
the **Website** field (if working in a multi-website environment).

A detailed description of this specific lot/serial number can also be added in
the **Description** tab below.

When all desired configurations are complete, click the **Save** button to
save all changes.

![New serial number created for existing product
stock.](../../../../../_images/serial-numbers-new-serial-number.png)

After a new serial number has been created, assigned to the desired product,
and saved, navigate back to the product form, by going to Products ‣ Products,
and selecting the product that this newly-created serial number was just
assigned to.

On that product’s detail form, click the **Lot/Serial Numbers** smart button
to view the new serial number.

## Manage serial numbers for shipping and receiving

Serial numbers can be assigned for both **incoming** and **outgoing** goods.
For incoming goods, serial numbers are assigned directly on the purchase order
form. For outgoing goods, serial numbers are assigned directly on the sales
order form.

### Manage serial numbers on receipts

Assigning serial numbers to **incoming** goods can be done directly from the
purchase order (PO).

To create a PO, go to the Purchase app ‣ Create. Doing so reveals a new, blank
request for quotation (RFQ) form.

On this RFQ form, fill out the necessary information, by adding a **Vendor** ,
and by adding the desired products to the **Product** lines, by clicking **Add
a product** , under the **Products** tab.

Choose the desired quantity of the product to order, by changing the number in
the **Quantity** column.

When the necessary configurations are complete, click **Confirm Order**. This
will convert the RFQ to a purchase order.

Then, click the **Receipt** smart button to be taken to the warehouse receipt
form page for that specific PO.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>Clicking <b>Validate</b> before assigning a serial number to the ordered product quantities
will cause a <b>User Error</b> pop-up to appear. The pop-up requires entry of a lot or
serial number for the ordered products. The <abbr title="request for quotation">RFQ</abbr> <b>cannot</b> be
validated without a serial number being assigned.</p>
</div> ![User error popup prompting serial number
entry.](../../../../../_images/serial-numbers-user-error-popup.png)

From here, click the **Additional Options** menu, represented by a `hamburger`
icon (four horizontal lines, located to the right of the **Unit of Measure**
column in the **Operations** tab). Clicking that icon reveals a **Detailed
Operations** pop-up.

In this pop-up, configure a number of different fields, including the
assignation of a serial number (or serial numbers) under the **Lot/Serial
Number Name** column, located at the bottom of the pop-up.

There are three ways to do this: manually assigning serial numbers,
automatically assigning serial numbers, and copy/pasting serial numbers from a
spreadsheet.

#### Assign serial numbers manually

To assign serial numbers manually, click **Add a line** from the **Detailed
Operations** pop-up, and first choose the location where the product will be
stored under the **To** column.

Then, type a new **Serial Number Name** , and set the **Done** quantity in the
appropriate columns.

Repeat this process for the quantity of products shown in the **Demand**
field, and until the **Quantity Done** field displays the correct (matching)
number of products processed.

#### Assign serial numbers automatically

If a large quantity of products need individual serial numbers assigned to
them, Konvergo ERP can automatically generate and assign serial numbers to each of the
individual products.

To accomplish this, start with the **First SN** field in the **Detailed
Operations** pop-up window, and type the first serial number in the desired
order to be assigned.

Then, in the **Number of SN** field, type the total number of items that need
newly-generated unique serial numbers assigned to them.

Finally, click **Assign Serial Numbers** , and a list will populate with new
serial numbers matching the ordered quantity of products.

![Automatic serial number assignment in detailed operations
popup.](../../../../../_images/serial-numbers-auto-assign-sn.png)

#### Copy/paste serial numbers from a spreadsheet

To copy and paste serial numbers from an existing spreadsheet, first populate
a spreadsheet with all of the serial numbers received from the supplier (or
manually chosen upon receipt). Then, copy and paste them in the **Lot/Serial
Number Name** column. Konvergo ERP will automatically create the necessary number of
lines based on the amount of numbers pasted in the column.

From here, the **To** locations and **Done** quantities can be manually
entered in each of the serial number lines.

![List of serial numbers copied in Excel
spreadsheet.](../../../../../_images/serial-numbers-excel-spreadsheet.png)
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>For purchase orders that include large quantities of products to receive, the best method of
serial number assignment is to automatically assign serial numbers using the <b>Assign
Serial Numbers</b> button located on the <abbr title="purchase order">PO</abbr>. This prevents any serial
numbers from being reused or duplicated, and improves traceability reporting.</p>
</div>

Once all product quantities have been assigned a serial number, click the
**Confirm** button to close the pop-up. Then, click **Validate**.

A **Traceability** smart button appears upon validating the receipt. Click the
**Traceability** smart button to see the updated **Traceability Report** ,
which includes: a **Reference** document, the **Product** being traced, the
**Lot/Serial #** , and more.

Once all product quantities have been assigned a serial number, click
**Confirm** to close the popup, and click **Validate**. A **Traceability**
smart button will appear upon validating the receipt. Click the
**Traceability** smart button to see the updated **Traceability Report** ,
which includes: a **Reference** document, the **Product** being traced, the
**Lot/Serial #** , and more.

### Manage serial numbers on delivery orders

Assigning serial numbers to **outgoing** goods can be done directly from the
sales order (SO).

To create an SO, navigate to the Sales app, and click the **Create** button.
Doing so reveals a new, blank quotation form. On this blank quotation form,
fill out the necessary information, by adding a **Customer** , and adding
products to the **Product** lines (in the **Order Lines** tab), by clicking
**Add a product**.

Then, choose the desired quantity to sell by changing the number in the
**Quantity** column.

Once the quotation has been filled out, click the **Confirm** button to
confirm the quotation. When the quotation is confirmed, the quotation becomes
an SO, and a **Delivery** smart button appears.

Click the **Delivery** smart button to view the warehouse receipt form for
that specific SO.

From here, click the **Additional Options** menu, represented by a `hamburger`
icon (four horizontal lines, located to the right of the **Unit of Measure**
column in the **Operations** tab). Clicking that icon reveals a **Detailed
Operations** pop-up.

In the pop-up, a **Lot/Serial Number** will be chosen by default, with each
product of the total **Reserved** quantity listed with their unique serial
numbers (most likely listed in sequential order).

To manually change a product’s serial number, click the drop-down menu under
**Lot/Serial Number** , and choose (or type) the desired serial number. Then,
mark the **Done** quantities, and click **Confirm** to close the pop-up.

Finally, click the **Validate** button to deliver the products.

![Serial numbers listed in detailed operations
popup.](../../../../../_images/serial-numbers-detailed-operations-popup.png)

Upon validating the delivery order, a **Traceability** smart button appears.
Click the **Traceability** smart button to see the updated **Traceability
Report** , which includes: a **Reference** document, the **Product** being
traced, the **Date** , and the **Lot/Serial #** assigned.

The **Traceability Report** can also include a **Reference** receipt from the
previous purchase order (PO), if any of the product quantities shared a serial
number assigned during receipt of that specific PO.

## Manage serial numbers for different operations types

By default in Konvergo ERP, the creation of new serial numbers is only allowed upon
**receiving** products from a purchase order. **Existing** serial numbers
cannot be used. For sales orders, the opposite is true: new serial numbers
cannot be created on the delivery order, only existing serial numbers can be
used.

To change the ability to use new (or existing) serial numbers on any operation
type, go to Inventory app ‣ Configuration ‣ Operations Types, and select the
desired **Operation Type**.

For the **Receipts** operation type, found on the **Operations Types** page,
the **Use Existing Lots/Serial Numbers** option can be enabled, by selecting
**Receipts** from the **Operations Types** page, clicking **Edit** , and then
clicking the checkbox beside the **Use Existing Lots/Serial Numbers** option
(in the **Traceability** section). Lastly, click the **Save** button to save
the changes.

For the **Delivery Orders** operation type, located on the **Operations
Types** page, the **Create New Lots/Serial Numbers** option can be enabled, by
selecting **Delivery Orders** from the **Operations Types** page, clicking
**Edit** , and clicking the checkbox beside the **Create New Lots/Serial
Numbers** option (in the **Traceability** section). Be sure to click **Save**
to save changes.

## Serial number traceability

Manufacturers and companies can refer to the traceability reports to see the
entire lifecycle of a product: where it came from (and when), where it was
stored, and who it went to.

To see the full traceability of a product, or group by serial numbers, go to
Inventory app ‣ Products ‣ Lots/Serial Numbers. Doing so reveals the
**Lots/Serial Numbers** dashboard.

From here, products with serial numbers assigned to them will be listed by
default, and can be expanded to show what serial numbers have been
specifically assigned to them.

To group by serial numbers (or lots), first remove any default filters from
the search bar in the upper-right corner. Then, click **Group By** , and
select **Add Custom Group** , which reveals a mini drop-down menu. From this
mini drop-down menu, select **Lot/Serial Number** , and click **Apply**.

Doing so reveals all existing serial numbers and lots, and can be expanded to
show all quantities of products with that assigned number. For unique serial
numbers that are not reused, there should be just one product per serial
number.
