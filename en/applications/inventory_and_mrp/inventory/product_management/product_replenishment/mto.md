# Replenish on order (MTO)

_Replenish on order_ , also known as _MTO_ (make to order), is a replenishment
strategy that creates a draft order for a product every time a sales order is
created for it. For products that are purchased from a vendor, a request for
quotation (RFQ) is created, while a sales order for a product manufactured in-
house triggers the creation of a manufacturing order. The creation of a RFQ or
manufacturing order occurs every time a sales order is created, regardless of
the current stock level of the product being ordered.

## Unarchive the Replenish on Order (MTO) route

By default, Konvergo ERP sets the MTO route as _archived_. This is because MTO is a
somewhat niche workflow that is only used by certain companies. However, it is
easy to unarchive the route in just a few simple steps.

To do so, begin by navigating to Inventory ‣ Configuration ‣ Routes. On the
**Routes** page, click the **Filters** button and select the **Archived**
option. This shows all routes that are currently archived.

Enable the checkbox next to **Replenish on Order (MTO)** , then click the
**Action** button to reveal a drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, select
**Unarchive**.

Finally, remove the **Archived** filter from the **Search…** bar. The
**Routes** page will now show all available routes, including **Replenish on
Order (MTO)** , which is now selectable on the inventory tab of each product
page.

it.](../../../../../_images/unarchived-mto.png)

## Configure a product to use the MTO route

With the MTO route unarchived, products can now be properly configured to use
replenish on order. To do so, begin by going to Inventory ‣ Products ‣
Products, then select an existing product, or click **Create** to configure a
new one.

On the product page, select the **Inventory** tab and enable the **Replenish
on Order (MTO)** route in the **Routes** section, along with one other route.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>The <b>Replenish on Order (MTO)</b> route <b>does not</b> work unless another route is selected
as well. This is because Konvergo ERP needs to know how to replenish the product when an order is placed
for it (buy it, manufacture it, etc.).</p>
</div> ![Select the MTO route and a second route on the Inventory
tab.](../../../../../_images/select-routes.png)

If the product is purchased from a vendor to fulfill sales orders, enable the
**Can be Purchased** checkbox under the product name. Doing so makes the
**Purchase** tab appear alongside the other settings tabs below.

Select the **Purchase** tab and specify a **Vendor** and the **Price** they
sell the product for.

vendor.](../../../../../_images/specify-vendor.png)

If the product is manufactured, make sure that it has a bill of materials
(BOM) configured for it. To do so, click the **Bill of Materials** smart
button at the top of the screen, then click **Create** on the **Bill of
Materials** page to configure a new BOM for the product.

On the blank BOM form, add the components used to manufacture the product on
the **Components** tab, along with the operations required for the
manufacturing workflow on the **Operations** tab.

Finally, click **Save** to save the BOM.

## Fulfill a sales order using the MTO route

After configuring a product to use the MTO route, a replenishment order is
created for it every time a sales order including the product is confirmed.
The type of order created depends on the second route selected in addition to
MTO.

For example, if _Buy_ was the second route selected, then a purchase order is
created upon confirmation of a sales order.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>When the <abbr title="make to order">MTO</abbr> route is enabled for a product, a replenishment order is always created upon
confirmation of a sales order. This is the case even if there is enough stock of the product
on-hand to fulfill the sales order, without buying or manufacturing additional units of it.</p>
</div>

While the MTO route can be used in unison with a variety of other routes, the
_Buy_ route is used as the example for this workflow. Begin by navigating to
the Sales app, then click **Create** , which opens a blank quotation form.

On the blank quotation form, add a **Customer** , then click **Add a product**
under the **Order Lines** tab, and enter a product that has been configured to
use the _MTO_ and _Buy_ routes. Click **Confirm** and the quotation is turned
into a sales order.

A **Purchase** smart button now appears in the top-right corner of the sales
order. Clicking it opens the RFQ associated with the sales order.

Click **Confirm Order** to confirm the RFQ, and turn it into a purchase order.
A green **Receive Products** button now appears at the top of the purchase
order. Once the products are received, click **Receive Products** to register
them into inventory.

Return to the sales order by clicking the **SO** breadcrumb, or by navigating
to Sales ‣ Orders ‣ Orders, and selecting the sales order.

Finally, click the **Delivery** smart button in the top-right of the order to
be taken to the delivery order. Once the products have been shipped to the
customer, click **Validate** to confirm the delivery.
