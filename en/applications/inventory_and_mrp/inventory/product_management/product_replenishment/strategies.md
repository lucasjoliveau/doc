# Selecting a replenishment strategy

In Konvergo ERP, there are two strategies for automatically replenishing inventory:
_reordering rules_ and the _make to order (MTO)_ route. Although these
strategies differ slightly, they both have similar consequences: triggering
the automatic creation of a PO or MO. The choice of which strategy to use
depends on the businessâ€™s manufacturing and delivery processes.

## Terminology

### Replenishment report and reordering rules

The replenishment report is a list of all products that have a negative
forecast quantity.

_Reordering rules_ are used to ensure thereâ€™s always a minimum amount of a
product in-stock, in order to manufacture products and/or fulfill sales
orders. When the stock level of a product reaches its minimum, Konvergo ERP
automatically generates a purchase order with the quantity needed to reach the
maximum stock level.

Reordering rules can be created and managed in the replenishment report, or
from the product form.

### Make to order

_Make to order (MTO)_ is a procurement route that creates a draft purchase
order (or manufacturing order) each time a sales order is confirmed,
**regardless of the current stock level**.

Unlike products replenished using reordering rules, Konvergo ERP automatically links
the sales order to the PO or MO generated by the MTO route.

Another difference between reordering rules and MTO is, with MTO, Konvergo ERP
generates a draft PO or MO immediately after the SO is confirmed. With
reordering rules, Konvergo ERP generates a draft PO or MO when the productâ€™s
forecasted stock falls below the set minimum quantity.

In addition, Konvergo ERP automatically adds quantities to the PO or MO as the
forecast changes, so long as the PO or MO is not confirmed.

The MTO route is the best replenishment strategy for products that are
customized, and/or for products that have no stock kept on-hand.

## Configuration

### Replenishment report and reordering rules

To access the replenishment report, go to Inventory app â€£ Operations â€£
Replenishment.

By default, the replenishment report dashboard shows every product that needs
to be manually reordered. If there is no specific rule for a product, Konvergo ERP
assumes the **Min Quantity** and **Max Quantity** stock are both `0.00`

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>For products that donâ€™t have a set reordering rule, Konvergo ERP calculates the forecast based on
confirmed sales orders, deliveries, and receipts. For products that have a set reordering rule,
Konvergo ERP calculates the forecast normally, but also takes into account the purchase/manufacturing
lead time and security lead time.</p>
</div> <div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>Before creating a new reordering rule, make sure the product has a <em>vendor</em> or a <em>bill of
materials</em> configured on the product form. To check this, go to Inventory app
â€£ Products â€£ Products, and select the product to open its product form. The vendor, if
configured, is listed in the <b>Purchase</b> tab, and the bill on materials, if configured,

replenishment report.</p>

To create a new reordering rule from the replenishment report, go to Inventory
app â€£ Operations â€£ Replenishment, click **Create** , and select the desired
product from the drop-down menu in the **Product** column. If necessary, a
**Min Quantity** and a **Max Quantity** can be configured in the corresponding
columns on the **Replenishment** report page, as well.

To create a new reordering rule from the product form, go to Inventory app â€£
Products â€£ Products, and select a product to open its product form. Click the
**Reordering Rules** smart button, click **Create** , and fill out the fields.

#### Replenishment report fields

The following fields are on the **Replenishment** report. If any of these
fields are not visible, click the **â‹® (additional options)** icon on the far
right side of the report, then click the checkbox next to a field to make it
visible.

  * **Product** : the product that requires a replenishment.

  * **Location** : the specific location where the product is stored.

  * **Warehouse** : the warehouse where the product is stored.

  * **On Hand** : the amount of product currently available.

  * **Forecast** : the amount of product available after all current orders (sales, manufacturing, purchase, etc.) are taken into account.

  * **Preferred Route** : how the product is procured, either **Buy** , **Manufactured** , **Dropship** , etc.

  * **Vendor** : the company from which the product is acquired.

  * **Bill of Materials** : the bill of materials for the product (if one is configured).

  * **Trigger** : how the replenishment is created, either **Auto** (automatically, once the **On Hand** quantity goes below the **Min Quantity**) or **Manual** (only when the replenishment is requested).

  * **Procurement Group** : the reference number for how the product is being acquired, such as a sales order, purchase order, or manufacturing order.

  * **Min Quantity** : the minimum amount of product that should be available. When inventory levels goes below this number, the replenishment is triggered.

  * **Max Quantity** : the amount of product that should be available after replenishing the product.

  * **Multiple Quantity** : if the product should be ordered in specific quantities, enter the number that should be ordered. For example, if the **Multiple Quantity** is set to `5`, and only 3 are needed, 5 products are replenished.

  * **To Order** : the amount of product that is currently needed, and will be ordered, if the **Order Once** or **Automate Orders** button is clicked.

  * **UoM** : the unit of measure used to acquire the product.

  * **Company** : the company for which the product is acquired.

By default, the quantity in the **To Order** field is the quantity required to
reach the set **Max Quantity**. However, the **To Order** quantity can be
adjusted by clicking on the field and changing the value. To replenish a
product manually, click **Order Once**.

To automate a replenishment from the **Replenishment** page, click **Automate
Orders** on the right-side of the line, represented by a **ðŸ”„ (circular
arrow)** icon.

When this button is clicked, Konvergo ERP will automatically generate a draft PO/MO
every time the forecasted stock level falls below the set **Min Quantity** of
the reordering rule.

On the **Replenishment** page, a reordering rule or manual replenishment can
be temporarily deactivated for a given period, by clicking the **ðŸ”• (snooze)**
icon on the far-right of the line.

![Snooze options to turn off notifications for reordering for a period of
time.](../../../../../_images/reordering-rule-snooze-settings.png)

A PO or MO created by a manual replenishment has a **Replenishment Report** as
the source document. A PO or MO created by an automated reordering rule has
the SO reference number(s) that triggered the rule as the source document.

## Make to order (MTO) route

Since the MTO route is recommended for customized products, the route is
hidden by default.

To activate the MTO route in Konvergo ERP:

    

  1. Go to Inventory app â€£ Configuration â€£ Settings.

  2. Activate the **Multi-Step Routes** setting, located under the **Warehouse** section, and click **Save**.

  3. Then, go to Inventory app â€£ Configuration â€£ Routes.

  4. Click on Filters â€£ Archived to show archived routes.

  5. Select the checkbox next to **Replenish on Order (MTO)** , and click on Action â€£ Unarchive.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Activating the <b>Multi-Step Routes</b> setting also activates <b>Storage
Locations</b>. If these features arenâ€™t applicable to the warehouse, disable these settings after
unarchiving the <abbr title="Make to Oder">MTO</abbr> route.</p>
</div>

To set a productâ€™s procurement route to MTO, go to Inventory app â€£ Products â€£
Products, and click on the desired product to open its product form.

Then, click the **Inventory** tab, and in the **Routes** section of options,
select **Replenish on Order (MTO)**.

For products purchased directly from a vendor, make sure the **Buy** route is
selected, in addition to the **Replenish on Order (MTO)** route. Also, make
sure a vendor is configured in the **Purchase** tab of the product form.

For products manufactured in-house, make sure the **Manufacture** route is
selected, in addition to the **Replenish on Order (MTO)** route. Also, make
sure a bill of materials is configured for the product, which is accessible
via the **Bill of Materials** smart button on the product form.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <abbr title="Make to Oder">MTO</abbr> route cannot be selected alone. <abbr title="Make to Oder">MTO</abbr> <b>only</b> works if the <b>Manufacture</b> or
