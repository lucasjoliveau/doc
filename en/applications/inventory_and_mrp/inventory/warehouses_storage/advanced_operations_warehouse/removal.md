# Removal strategies (FIFO, LIFO, FEFO)

For companies with warehouses, **removal strategies** determine which products
are taken from the warehouse, and when. Removal strategies are typically
defined for specific picking operations. This helps companies to select the
best products, optimize the distance workers need to travel when picking items
for orders, and account for quality control, such as moving products with
expiration dates.

Usually, _Removal Strategies_ are defined in picking operations to select the
best products to optimize the distance for the worker, for quality control
purposes, or to first move the products with the closest expiration date.

When a product needs to be moved, Konvergo ERP finds available products that can be
assigned to the transfer. The way Konvergo ERP assigns these products depends on the
**Removal Strategy** defined in either the **Product Category** or the
**Location** dashboards.

To change the **Removal Strategy** , go to Inventory app ‣ Configuration ‣
Locations or Product Categories. Click on a **Location** or **Product
Category** , and then click **Edit**. Change the product category **Force
Removal Strategy** or the location **Removal Strategy** by clicking on the
drop-down menu and selecting the desired removal strategy. After selecting the
new removal strategy, click **Save**.

Locations.](../../../../../_images/product-category-location.png)

## What happens inside the warehouse?

Most warehouses share the same important areas: receiving docks and sorting
areas, storage locations, picking and packing areas, and shipping/loading
docks. While all products entering or leaving the warehouse might go through
each of these locations at some point, removal strategies can have an effect
on which products are taken, from where, and when.

In this example below, vendor trucks unload pallets of goods at the receiving
docks. Then, operators scan the products in the receiving area, with the
reception date and expiration date. After that, products are stored in their
respective storage locations.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Not all products have expiration dates, but in this example, expiration dates apply.</p>
</div> ![Products entering stock via the receiving
area.](../../../../../_images/entering-stocks.png)

In Konvergo ERP, receive products by navigating to the Inventory application, and in
the kanban view, click on either the **Receipts** heading or **# TO PROCESS**
button. On the **Receipts** dashboard, find and click on the individual
receipt which will open the warehouse intake form. Click **Edit** , and then
enter the received quantity in the **Done** column. To finish, **Validate** to
receive the products and register them in the Konvergo ERP database.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Receiving products can also be done within the Konvergo ERP <em>Barcode</em> application. If using the
<em>Barcode</em> app, scan the product(s), update the quantity, and finally, click <b>Validate</b>.
After products are received in Konvergo ERP, the products can then be moved to their respective storage
locations.</p>
</div>

Continuing with the same example, below, imagine several sales orders are made
for the products received earlier, that use expiration dates. In this example,
the products weren’t received on the same day, and they don’t have the same
expiration date. In this situation, logically, sending products with the
closest expiration date is preferred, instead of products received first or
last. Using the chosen removal strategy configured for those products (in this
example, FEFO), Konvergo ERP generates a transfer for the products with the soonest
expiration date to the picking area, then the packing area, and finally, to
the shipping docks for delivery to the customer.

expiration dates into account.](../../../../../_images/packing-products.png)

## How each removal strategy works

Removal strategies determine which products are taken from the warehouse when
orders are confirmed.

### First In, First Out (FIFO)

When using a **First In, First Out (FIFO)** strategy, demand for a product
triggers a removal rule, which requests a transfer for the lot/serial number
that entered the stock first (and therefore, has been in stock for the longest
time).

For example, imagine there are three lots of nails in the warehouse, and have
the corresponding lot numbers: `00001`, `00002`, `00003`. Each lot has five
boxes of nails in it.

Lot `00001` entered the stock on May 23, lot `00002` on May 25, and lot
`00003` on June 1. A customer orders six boxes on June 11.

Using the FIFO removal strategy, a transfer request will pick the five boxes
from lot `00001` first, and then from the boxes in lot `00002`, since lot
`00001` entered the stock first. The box from lot `00002` is taken next
because it has the oldest receipt date after lot `00001`.

![The detailed operations for the transfer shows the nail lots to be
removed.](../../../../../_images/fifo-nails-picking.png)

### Last In, First Out (LIFO)

Similar to the FIFO method, the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** removal strategy
moves products based on the date they entered a warehouse’s stock. Instead of
removing the oldest stock on-hand, however, it targets the **newest** stock
on-hand for removal.

Every time an order for products with the LIFO method is placed, a transfer is
created for the lot/serial number that has most recently entered the stock
(the **last** lot/serial number that entered the warehouse’s inventory).

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>In many countries, the <abbr title="Last In, First Out">LIFO</abbr> removal strategy in banned, since it can
potentially result in old, expired, or obsolete products being delivered to customers.</p>
</div>

For example, imagine there are three lots of boxes of screws in the warehouse,
and have the corresponding lot numbers: `10001`, `10002`, and `10003`, each
with 10 boxes of screws per lot.

Lot `10001` entered the stock on June 1, lot `10002` on June 3, and lot
`10003` on June 6. A customer orders seven boxes on June 8.

Using the LIFO removal strategy, a transfer is requested for seven boxes of
screws from lot `10003` because that lot is the last one to have entered the
stock.

![The detailed operations shows which lots are being selected for the
picking.](../../../../../_images/lifo-nails.png)

### First Expired, First Out (FEFO)

While the FIFO and LIFO methods target products for removal based on date of
entry into the warehouse, the **First Expired, First Out (FEFO)** method
targets products for removal based on their assigned expiration dates.

Using the FEFO removal strategy, every sales order that includes products with
this removal strategy assigned ensures that transfers are requested for
products with the expiration date soonest to the order date.

As an example, imagine there are three lots of six-egg boxes. Those three lots
have the following lot numbers: `20001`, `20002`, and `20003`, each with five
boxes in it.

Lot `20001` entered the stock on July 1 and expires on July 15, lot `20002`
entered on July 2 and expires on July 14, and lot `20003` entered on July 3
and expires on July 21. A customer orders six boxes on July 5.

Using the FEFO method, a transfer is requested for the five boxes from lot
`20002` and one from lot `20001`. All the boxes in lot `20002` are transferred
because they have the earliest expiration date. The transfer also requests one
box from lot `20001` because it has the next closest expiration date after lot
`20002`.

![The detailed operations for the transfer shows the lots to be
removed.](../../../../../_images/egg-lots-removal.png)

## Using removal strategies

To differentiate some units of products from others, the units need to be
tracked, either by **Lot** or by **Serial Number**. To do so, go to Inventory
‣ Configuration ‣ Settings. Then, activate the **Storage Locations** ,
**Multi-Step Routes** , and **Lots & Serial Numbers** settings. Click **Save**
to save changes.

![:alt: Traceability settings.](../../../../../_images/traceability.png)
![:alt: Warehouse settings.](../../../../../_images/warehouse-settings.png)
<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>To use the <abbr title="First Expired, First Out">FEFO</abbr> removal strategy, the <b>Expiration
Dates</b> setting needs to be activated as well. To enable this, go to Inventory app
‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, scroll down to the <b>Traceability</b> section, and click
the checkbox next to <b>Expiration Dates</b>. Remember to click <b>Save</b> to save all
changes.</p>
</div>

Now, specific removal strategies can be defined on product categories. To do
this, go to Inventory app ‣ Configuration ‣ Product Categories, and choose a
product category to define the removal strategy on. In the **Force Removal
Strategy** field, choose a removal strategy.

The _First Expired, First Out_ (FEFO) strategy is a bit different from the
other two removal strategies. For FEFO, the expiration date is important, not
the date the product entered the stock.

For example, imagine there are three lots of six-egg boxes (in this specific
case, don’t forget to use [units of
measure](../../product_management/product_replenishment/uom)). Those
three lots have the following numbers: **20001** , **20002** , and **20003** ,
each with five boxes in it.

**20001** entered the stock on the 1st of July and expires on the 15th of
July, **20002** entered on the 2nd and expires on the 14th of July, and
**20003** entered on the 4th and expires on the 21st of July. A customer
orders six boxes on the 5th of July. With the FEFO strategy selected, a
transfer is requested for the five boxes of **20002** and one from **20001**.
The transfer for all the boxes in lot **20002** is because they have the
closest expiration date. The transfer also requests one box from **20001**
because has the next closest expiration date after lot **20002**.

Basically, for every sales order of a product with the FEFO strategy, a
transfer is requested for the product that has the nearest expiration date
from the order date.

### Closest Location

The _Closest Location_ strategy is completely different from the other removal
strategies. It is not related to the date of entry in the warehouse, but
rather the location of the product. It is commonly used for products that do
not deteriorate with time.

The aim is to avoid making the warehouse worker take a long journey to the
bottom of the stock when the product is also located at a near location. This
method is only available if the **Storage Locations** setting is on. The
closest location is actually the one that comes first in the alphabetic order.

## Use removal strategies

To differentiate some units from others, the units need to be tracked, either
by _lot_ or by _serial number_. To do so, go to Inventory ‣ Configuration ‣
Settings. Then, activate the **Storage Location** , **Multi-Step Routes** ,
and **Lots & Serial Numbers** settings.

![Removal strategy on a product category.](../../../../../_images/enabled-
features.png)

To view all products with lots/serial numbers assigned to them, navigate to
Inventory app ‣ Products ‣ Lots/Serial Numbers. This reveals a page with drop-
down menus of all products assigned lots or serial numbers, filtered by
_product_ by default. To change the category these products are filtered by,
click **Product** (in the search bar, in the top right of the page) to remove
the default filter, and select a new filter if desired.

![Click on Products, then Lots/Serial Numbers to display all the products with
lots or serial numbers.](../../../../../_images/lot-serial.png)

To view the serial numbers being selected for a sales order, go to the **Sales
app** and select the sales order in question. In the sales order, click the
**Delivery** smart button in the top right. In the **Operations** tab, click
the **⦙≣ (Detailed Operations)** icon in the far right for the product in
question. The **Detailed Operations** window appears, and displays the lot or
serial numbers selected for that specific product for the delivery order.

### FIFO (First In, First Out)

The FIFO removal strategy implies that products which enter a warehouse’s
stock first are removed first. Companies should use this method if they are
selling products with short demand cycles, such as clothes, to ensure they are
not stuck with outdated styles in stock.

In this example, there are three lots of white shirts. The shirts are from the
_All/Clothes_ category, where _FIFO_ is set as the removal strategy. In the
**Inventory Valuation Report** , the three different receipts are listed with
the amounts.

![View of the lots of white shirts in the inventory valuation
report.](../../../../../_images/inventory-valuation.png)

Lot `000001` contains five shirts, lot `000002` contains three shirts, and lot
`000003` contains two shirts.

To see the removal strategy in action, go to the Sales app and click
**Create** to create a sales order. Next, select a **Customer** from the drop-
down menu. Then click **Add a product** in the **Order Lines** tab. Select a
product (for this example, the **White Shirt**) from the drop-down menu, or
type in the name of the product in the field. Enter a quantity (for this
example, `6.00`) in the **Quantity** field, then click **Save** , then click
**Confirm**.

Once the sales order is confirmed, the delivery order will be created and
linked to the picking, and the oldest lot numbers will be reserved thanks to
the FIFO strategy. All five shirts from lot `000001` and one shirt from lot
`000002` will be selected to be sent to the customer.

![Two lots being reserved for a sales order with the FIFO
strategy.](../../../../../_images/reserved-lots-fifo-strategy.png)

### LIFO (Last In, First Out)

The LIFO removal strategy works in the **opposite** manner from the FIFO
strategy. With this method, the products that are received **last** are moved
out first. This method is mostly used for products without a shelf life, and
no time-sensitive factors, such as expiration dates.

In this example, there are three lots of cinder blocks. The blocks are from
the _All/Building Materials_ category, where _FIFO_ is set as the removal
strategy. In the **Inventory Valuation Report** , the three different receipts
are listed with the amounts.

![View of the lots of cinder blocks in the inventory valuation
report.](../../../../../_images/inventory-valuation-bricks.png)

Lot `000020` contains three cinder blocks, lot `000030` contains five cinder
blocks, and lot `0000400` contains four cinder blocks.

To see how the LIFO strategy works, first navigate to Inventory app ‣
Configuration ‣ Product Categories, and select a product category (for this
example, the **All/Building Materials** category) to edit. This reveals a
product category form.

Once on the product category form, under the **Logistics** section, change the
**Force Removal Strategy** to **Last In First Out (LIFO)**.

![Last in first out \(LIFO\) strategy set up as forced removal
strategy.](../../../../../_images/last-in-first-out.png)

To see the removal strategy in action, go to the Sales app and click
**Create** to create a sales order. Next, select a **Customer** from the drop-
down menu. Then click **Add a product** in the **Order Lines** tab. Select a
product (for this example, the **Cinder Block**) from the drop-down menu, or
type in the name of the product in the field. Enter a quantity (for this
example, `5.00`) in the **Quantity** field, then click **Save** , then click
**Confirm**.

Once the sales order is confirmed, the delivery order will be created and
linked to the picking, and the newest lot numbers will be reserved thanks to
the LIFO strategy. All four cinder blocks from lot `0000400` and one cinder
block from lot `000030` will be selected to be sent to the customer.

![Two lots being reserved for sale with the LIFO
strategy.](../../../../../_images/reserved-lots-lifo-strategy.png)

### FEFO (First Expired, First Out)

The FEFO removal strategy differs from the FIFO and LIFO strategies, because
it targets products for removal based on **expiration dates** instead of their
warehouse receipt dates. With this method, the products that are going to
expire first are moved out first. This method is used for perishable products,
such as medicine, food, and beauty products.

Lots are picked based on their **removal date** from earliest to latest.
Removal dates indicate how many days _before_ the expiration date the product
needs to be removed from stock. The removal date is set on the product form.
Lots without a removal date defined are picked after lots with removal dates.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>If products are not removed from stock when they should be, lots that are past the expiration
date may still be picked for delivery orders!</p>
</div> <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>For more information about expiration dates, reference the <a href="../../product_management/product_tracking/expiration_dates">Expiration dates</a> document.</p>
</div>

First, go to Inventory app ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings and ensure **Expiration
Dates** is enabled. Once the **Expiration Dates** setting is enabled, it’s
possible to define different expiration dates for individual serialized
products, as well as for lot numbers containing many products.

In this example, there are three lots of hand cream. The creams are from the
_All/Health & Beauty_ category, where _FEFO_ is set as the removal strategy.
In the **Inventory Valuation Report** , the three different receipts are
listed with the amounts.

Lot `0000001` contains twenty tubes of hand cream, expiring on Sept 30, lot
`0000002` contains ten tubes of hand cream, expiring on November 30, and lot
`0000003` contains ten tubes of hand cream, expiring on October 31.

![View the hand cream lot numbers and expiration dates in the inventory
report.](../../../../../_images/hand-cream-lots.png)

Expiration dates can be entered when validating the received products, or set
on products by going to Inventory app ‣ Products ‣ Lots/Serial Numbers. Click
**Create** , enter the serial number, and select the product from the drop-
down menu. Next, select the expiration date in the **Dates** tab. Finally,
click **Save**.

![View of the removal date for 0000001.](../../../../../_images/removal-
date.png)

To see how the FEFO strategy works, first navigate to Inventory app ‣
Configuration ‣ Product Categories, and select a product category (in this
example, the **All/Health & Beauty** category) to edit. This reveals a product
category form.

Once on the product category form, under the **Logistics** section, change the
**Force Removal Strategy** to FEFO.

![FEFO forced removal strategy set on the product
category.](../../../../../_images/fefo.png)

Next, go to the Sales app and click **Create** to create a sales order. Next,
select a **Customer** from the drop-down menu. Then click **Add a product** in
the **Order Lines** tab. Select a product (for this example, the **Hand
Cream**) from the drop-down menu, or type in the name of the product in the
field. Enter a quantity (in this example, `25.00`) in the **Quantity** field,
then click **Save** , then click **Confirm**.

Once the sales order is confirmed, the delivery order will be created and
linked to the picking, and the lot numbers expiring first will be reserved
thanks to the FEFO strategy. All twenty tubes of hand cream from lot `0000001`
and five from lot `0000003` will be selected to be sent to the customer,
detailed in the **Detailed Operations** tab in the sales order.
