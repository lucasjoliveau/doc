# Organize a cross-dock in a warehouse

Cross-docking is the process of sending products that are received directly to
the customers, without making them enter the stock. The trucks are simply
unloaded in a _Cross-Dock_ area in order to reorganize products and load
another truck.

Note

For more information on how to organize your warehouse, read our blog: [What
is cross-docking and is it for me?](https://www.odoo.com/blog/business-

## Configuration

In the _Inventory_ app, open Configuration ‣ Settings and activate the _Multi-
Step Routes_.

Note

Doing so will also enable the _Storage Locations_ feature.

Now, both _Incoming_ and _Outgoing_ shipments should be configured to work
with 2 steps. To adapt the configuration, go to Inventory ‣ Configuration ‣
Warehouses and edit your warehouse.

This modification will lead to the creation of a _Cross-Docking_ route that
can be found in Inventory ‣ Configuration ‣ Routes.

## Configure products with Cross-Dock Route

Create the product that uses the _Cross-Dock Route_ and then, in the inventory
tab, select the routes _Buy_ and _Cross-Dock_. Now, in the purchase tab,
specify the vendor to who you buy the product and set a price for it.

Once done, create a sale order for the product and confirm it. Odoo will
automatically create two transfers which will be linked to the sale order. The
first one is the transfer from the _Input Location_ to the _Output Location_ ,
corresponding to the move of the product in the _Cross-Dock_ area. The second
one is the delivery order from the _Output Location_ to your _Customer
Location. Both are in state *Waiting Another Operation_ because we still need
to order the product to our supplier.

Now, go to the _Purchase_ app. There, you will find the purchase order that
has been automatically triggered by the system. Validate it and receive the
products in the _Input Location_.

![../../../../../_images/cross10.png](../../../../../_images/cross10.png)

When the products have been received from the supplier, you can go back to
your initial sale order and validate the internal transfer from _Input_ to
_Output_.

The delivery order is now ready to be processed and can be validated too.
