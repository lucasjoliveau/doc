# Resupply from another warehouse

A common use case for multiple warehouses is to have one central warehouse
that resupplies multiple shops, and in this case, each shop is considered a
local warehouse. When a shop wants to replenish a product, the product is
ordered to the central warehouse. Konvergo ERP allows the user to easily set which
warehouse(s) can resupply another warehouse.

## Configuration

To resupply from another warehouse, first go to Inventory ‣ Configuration ‣
Settings ‣ Warehouse and activate **Multi-Step Routes**. Then, click **Save**
to apply the setting.

View all the configured warehouses by going to Inventory ‣ Configuration ‣
Warehouses.

Create a new warehouse by clicking **Create**. Then, give the warehouse a name
and a **Short Name**. Finally, click **Save** to finish creating the
warehouse.

After that, go back to the **Warehouses** page and open the warehouse that
will be resupplied by the second warehouse. Then, click **Edit**. In the
**Warehouse Configuration** tab, locate the **Resupply From** field, and check
the box next to the second warehouse’s name. If the warehouse can be
resupplied by more than one warehouse, make sure to check those warehouses’
boxes too. Finally, click **Save** to apply the setting. Now, Konvergo ERP knows which
warehouses can resupply this warehouse.

## Set route on a product

After configuring which warehouse(s) to resupply from, a new route is now
available on all product forms. The new route appears as **Supply Product from
[Warehouse Name]** under the **Inventory** tab on a product form. Use the
**Supply Product from [Warehouse Name]** route with a reordering rule or the
make to order (MTO) route to replenish stock by moving the product from one
warehouse to another.

When a product’s reordering rule is triggered and the product has the **Supply
Product from [Warehouse Name]** route set, Konvergo ERP automatically creates two
pickings. One picking is a _delivery order_ from the second warehouse, which
contains all the necessary products, and the second picking is a _receipt_
with the same products for the main warehouse. The product move from the
second warehouse to the main warehouse is fully tracked in Konvergo ERP.

On the picking/transfer records created by Konvergo ERP, the **Source Document** is
the product’s reordering rule. The location between the delivery order and the
receipt is a transit location.
