# Create alternative requests for quotation for multiple vendors

Sometimes, companies might want to request offers from multiple vendors at the
same time, by inviting those vendors to submit offers for similar goods or
services all at once. This helps companies to select the cheapest (and
fastest) vendors, depending on their specific business needs.

In Konvergo ERP, this can be done by adding alternative requests for quotation (RFQs)
for different vendors. Once a response is received from each vendor, the
product lines from each RFQ can be compared, and a decision can be made for
which products to purchase from which vendors.

Sometimes referred to as a _call for tender_ , this process is primarily used
by organizations in the public sector, who are legally bound to use it when
making a purchase. However, private companies can also use alternative RFQs to
spend money efficiently, as well.

## Configure purchase agreement settings

To create alternative RFQs directly from a quotation, the _Purchase
Agreements_ feature first needs to be enabled in the settings of the
_Purchase_ app. To do this, go to Purchase ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, and
under the **Orders** section, click the checkbox next to **Purchase
Agreements**. Doing so will enable the ability to create alternative RFQs, as
well as the ability to create _blanket orders_.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>To save time on a <em>call for tender</em>, custom vendors, prices, and delivery lead times can be set
in the <b>Purchase</b> tab on a product form. To do so, navigate to
Purchase ‣ Products ‣ Products, and select a product to edit. From the
product form, click the <b>Purchase tab</b>, then click <b>Add a line</b>. From the
drop-down menu, choose a vendor to set under the <b>Vendor</b> column, and set a
<b>Price</b> and <b>Delivery Lead Time</b> if desired. Clicking the
<b>additional options (two-dots)</b> icon provides additional visibility options to add to
the line item.</p>
</div>

## Create an RFQ

To create a new RFQ, navigate to the Purchase app, and click **New**.

Then, add information to the RFQ form: add a vendor from the drop-down next to
the **Vendor** field, and click **Add a product** to select a product from the
drop-down menu in the **Product** column. Then, set the desired purchase
quantity in the **Quantity** column, and change the purchase price in the
**Unit Price** column, if desired.

Clicking the **additional options (two-dots)** icon provides additional
visibility options to add to the line item. Repeat these steps to add as many
options as desired, including the **UoM** (Units of Measure) to purchase the
products in, and the **Expected Arrival** date.

Once ready, click **Send by Email**. This causes a **Compose Email** pop-up
window to appear, wherein the message to the vendor can be customized. Once
ready, click **Send**. This turns the RFQ into a purchase order (PO), and
sends an email to the vendor listed on the purchase order form.

![Compose and send quotation email pop-up.](../../../../_images/calls-for-
tenders-email-popup.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Sending emails to each vendor can be useful when creating alternative
<abbr title="Requests for Quotation">RFQs</abbr>, because vendors can confirm if their past prices still
hold today, which can help companies choose the best offers for them.</p>
</div>

## Create alternatives to an RFQ

Once a PO is created and sent by email to a vendor, alternative RFQs can be
created and sent to additional, alternate vendors to compare prices, delivery
times, and other factors to make a decision from which vendors to order which
products.

To create alternative RFQs, click the **Alternatives** tab from the purchase
order form, then click **Create Alternative**. When clicked, a **Create
alternative** pop-up window appears.

![Calls for tenders pop-up to create alternative
quotation.](../../../../_images/calls-for-tenders-alternatives-popup.png)

From this window, select a new/different vendor from the drop-down menu next
to the **Vendor** field to assign this alternative quotation to.

Next to this, there is a **Copy Products** checkbox that is selected by
default. When selected, the product quantities of the original PO are copied
to the alternative. For this first alternative quotation, leave the checkbox
checked. Once finished, click **Create Alternative**. This creates (and
navigates to) a new PO.

Since the **Create Alternative** checkbox was left checked, this new purchase
order form is already populated with the same products, quantities, and other
details as the previous, original PO.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>When the <b>Copy Products</b> checkbox is selected while creating an alternative quotation,
additional products do not need to be added on the purchase order form unless desired. However,
if a chosen vendor is listed in the <b>Vendor</b> column under the <b>Purchase</b> tab
on a product form included in the purchase order, the values set on the product form carry over
to the <abbr title="Purchase Order">PO</abbr>, and have to be changed manually, if desired.</p>
</div>

Once ready, create a second alternative quotation by clicking the
**Alternatives** tab, and once again, click **Create Alternative**. This
causes the **Create alternative** pop-up window to appear again. This time,
choose a different vendor from the drop-down menu next to **Vendor** , and
this time, _uncheck_ the **Copy Products** checkbox. Then, click **Create
Alternative**.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>If an alternative quotation needs to be removed from the <b>Alternatives</b> tab, they can
be individually removed by clicking on the <b>Remove (X)</b> icon at the end of their row.</p>
</div>

This creates a third, new purchase order. But, since the product quantities of
the original PO were _not_ copied over, the product lines are empty, and new
products need to be added by clicking **Add a product** , and selecting the
desired products from the drop-down menu. Once the desired number of products
are added, click **Send by Email**.

![Blank alternative quotation with alternatives in
breadcrumbs.](../../../../_images/calls-for-tenders-blank-alternative.png)

This causes a **Compose Email** pop-up window to appear, wherein the message
to the vendor can be customized. Once ready, click **Send** to send an email
to the vendor listed on the purchase order form.

From this newest purchase order form, click the **Alternatives** tab. Under
this tab, all three purchase orders can be seen in the **Reference** column.
Additionally, the vendors are listed under the **Vendor** column, and the
order **Total** and **Status** of the orders are in the rows, as well.

## Link a new RFQ to existing quotations

Creating alternative quotations directly from a purchase order form under the
**Alternatives** tab is the easiest way to create and link quotations.
However, separate RFQs can also be linked _after_ the fact, even if they are
created completely separately at first.

To create a new RFQ, navigate to the Purchase app, and click **New**.

Then, add information to the RFQ form: add a vendor from the drop-down next to
the **Vendor** field, and click **Add a product** to select a product from the
drop-down menu in the **Product** column. Then, set the desired purchase
quantity in the **Quantity** column, and change the purchase price in the
**Unit Price** column, if desired.

Once ready, click **Send by Email**. This causes a **Compose Email** pop-up
window to appear, wherein the message to the vendor can be customized. Once
ready, click **Send** to send an email to the vendor listed on the purchase
order form.

Then, click the **Alternatives** tab once more. Since this new PO was created
separately, there are no other orders linked yet. To link this order with the
alternatives created previously, click **Link to Existing RfQ** on the first
line in the **Vendor** column.

![pop-up to link new quotation to existing RFQs.](../../../../_images/calls-
for-tenders-link-existing-rfq.png)

This causes an **Add: Alternative POs** pop-up window to appear. Select the
three purchase orders created previously, and click **Select**. All of these
orders are now copied to this PO under the **Alternatives** tab.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>If a large number of purchase orders are being processed and the previous
<abbr title="Purchase Orders">POs</abbr> can’t be located, try clicking Group By ‣
Vendor under the search bar at the top of the pop-up window to group by the vendors selected on
the previous orders.</p>
</div>

## Compare product lines

When there are multiple RFQs linked as alternatives, they can be compared
side-by-side in order to determine which vendors offer the best deals on which
products. To compare each quotation, go to the Purchase app, and select one of
the quotations created previously.

Then, click the **Alternatives** tab to see all the linked RFQs. Next, under
the **Create Alternative** tab, click **Compare Product Lines**. This
navigates to a Compare Order Lines page.

![Compare Product Lines page for alternative RFQs.](../../../../_images/calls-
for-tenders-compare-product-lines.png)

The Compare Order Lines page, by default, groups by **Product**. Each product
included in any of the RFQs is displayed in its own drop-down, along with all
of the PO numbers in the **Reference** column.

Additional columns on this page include the **Vendor** from which products
were ordered, the **Status** of the quotation (i.e., RFQ, RFQ Sent); the
**Quantity** of products ordered from each vendor; the **Unit Price** per
product and **Total** price of the order, and more.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>To remove product lines from the Compare Order Lines page, click <b>Clear</b> at the far
right end of that product line’s row. This removes this product as a chooseable option from the
page, and changes the <b>Total</b> price of that product on the page to <b>0</b>. On the
purchase order form in which that product was included, its ordered quantity is changed to
<b>0</b>, as well.</p>
</div>

Once the best offers have been identified, at the end of each row, individual
products can be selected by clicking **Choose**. Once all the desired products
have been chosen, click **Requests for Quotation** (in the breadcrumbs, at the
top of the page) to navigate back to an overview of all RFQs.

## Cancel (or keep) alternatives

Now that the desired products have been chosen, based on which vendors
provided the best offer, the other RFQs (from which no products were chosen)
can be canceled.

Under the **Total** column, at the far right of each row, the orders from
which no products were chosen have automatically had their total cost set to
**0**. Although they haven’t been canceled yet, this means that they can
ultimately be canceled without repercussions, _after_ the desired purchase
orders have been confirmed.

![Canceled quotations in the Purchase app
overview.](../../../../_images/calls-for-tenders-canceled-quotes.png)

To confirm a quotation that contains the chosen product quantities, click into
one. Then, click **Confirm Order**. This causes an **Alternative Warning**
pop-up window to appear. From there, either **Cancel Alternatives** or **Keep
Alternatives** can be clicked. If this PO should _not_ be confirmed, click
**Cancel**.

**Cancel Alternatives** automatically cancels the alternative purchase orders.
**Keep Alternatives** keeps the alternative purchase orders open, so they can
still be accessed if any additional product quantities need to be ordered.
Once all products are ordered, **Cancel Alternatives** can be selected from
whichever PO is open.

To view a detailed form of one of the RFQs listed, click the line item for
that quotation. This causes an **Open: Alternative POs** pop-up window to
appear, from which all details of that particular quotation can be viewed.
Click **Close** when finished.

![Keep or cancel pop-up for alternative RFQs.](../../../../_images/calls-for-
tenders-keep-cancel-alternatives.png)

From the **Alternative Warning** pop-up window, click **Keep Alternatives** to
keep all alternative quotations open for now. Then, click **Requests for
Quotation** (in the breadcrumbs, at the top of the page) to navigate back to
an overview of all RFQs.

Click into the remaining quotation(s) that contain products that need to be
ordered, and click **Confirm Order**. This causes the **Alternative Warning**
pop-up window to appear again. This time, click **Cancel Alternatives** to
cancel all other alternative RFQs linked with this quotation.

Finally, click **Requests for Quotation** (in the breadcrumbs, at the top of
the page) to navigate back to an overview of all RFQs. The canceled orders can
be seen greyed out and listed with a **Cancelled** status under the **Status**
column at the far right of their rows.

Now that all product quantities have been ordered, the purchase process can be
followed, and continued to completion, until the products are received into
the warehouse.
