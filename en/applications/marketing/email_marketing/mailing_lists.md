# Mailing lists

Mailing lists are important for a number of reasons. Mailing lists can provide
valuable leads for sales teams, communicate with focus groups participants,
contact consumers directly for useful feedback, and more.

## Create mailing lists

To create a mailing list in the _Email Marketing_ application, navigate to
Mailing lists ‣ Mailing lists ‣ Create. Clicking **Create** reveals a pop-up
window.

application.](../../../_images/new-mailing-list-popup.png)

In the pop-up, name the mailing list and designate if the mailing list should
be public with the **Is Public** checkbox.

The **Is Public** option allows the mailing list to be accessible by
recipients in the unsubscription page, making it possible for them to update
their subscription preferences.

After those options have been configured, click **Create** to create the
mailing list, which Konvergo ERP automatically adds to the **Mailing Lists** page.

## Add contacts to a mailing list

After a mailing list has been created (and added to the **Mailing Lists**
dashboard), click on the desired mailing list to add contacts to the list.

Clicking the desired mailing list reveals a separate **Mailing List Contacts**
page, in which contacts can be added to this specific list by clicking
**Create** , and adding contact information directly on a separate contact
detail form.

Or, while in the Email Marketing application, navigate to Mailing Lists ‣
Mailing List Contacts. Doing so reveals a separate page with all the mailing
list contacts in the database.

From here, click **Create** , and add a contact with the same previous steps.
Or, click the **Import** icon (to the right of the **Create** button) to
import contacts into the database.

Once contacts are in the database, click into the desired contact’s detail
form, and add the preferred mailing list in the **Mailing List** tab (at the
bottom of the contact detail form), by clicking **Add a line** , and selecting
the desired mailing list. Multiple mailing lists can be added to a single
contact’s detail form.

### Create new mailing list from contact detail form

To create a mailing list from a contact detail form, click **Add a line** ,
and type in the name of a new mailing list in the empty field that appears.
Then, select either **Create** or **Create and Edit…**.

The **Create** option quickly creates the mailing list to the contact detail
form, and the list can be configured at a later date. The **Create and Edit…**
option creates the mailing list, and reveals a pop-up window, in which the new
mailing list can be configured right away.

## Link a mailing list to website (Newsletter blocks)

When a mailing list is created in the database, Konvergo ERP provides the option to
directly link the mailing list on the Konvergo ERP-built website (created via Konvergo ERP’s
**Website** application).

To link a mailing list to a website, navigate to the front-end of the website,
and enter **Edit** mode by clicking **Edit** in the upper-right corner. When
clicked, Konvergo ERP reveals a right-sidebar, filled with drag-and-drop _Building
Blocks_ that are packed with various features, options, and design elements.

Then, to add a _subscription field_ for a specific mailing list onto a
website, drag-and-drop any of the **Newsletter** options (**Newsletter Block**
, **Newsletter Popup** , or **Newsletter**).

mode on the front-end of the website), type <code>Newsletter</code> into the search bar, located in the
right sidebar, under the <b>Blocks</b> tab, and Konvergo ERP reveals the three different
<b>Newsletter</b> block options.</p>

</div>

When a **Newsletter** block is dragged onto the body of the website, Konvergo ERP
reveals a pop-up window, in which the desired mailing list is selected from a
drop-down menu (and linked) to this block on the website.

Website.](../../../_images/add-mailing-list-popup-website.png)

  * **Newsletter Block** \- Adds a block onto the webpage, providing visitors with the option to add their email address to this mailing list, and subscribe to future communications.

Here’s an example of a **Newsletter Block**.

![View of a sample newsletter block in the Konvergo ERP Website
application.](../../../_images/newsletter-block-sample.png)

  * **Newsletter Popup** \- Tells Konvergo ERP to reveal a subscription pop-up window to occur at a certain part of the webpage. When the visitor scrolls to this predetermined point, a pop-up subscription window appears, asking for their email address to subscribe to the mailing list. The pop-up window can be edited further to fit any business needs.

Here’s an example of a **Newsletter Popup**.

  * **Newsletter** \- Provides visitors with a simple field to add their email address to the mailing list, and subscribe to future mailings in the footer (or anywhere else on the page).

Here’s an example of a **Newsletter** dynamic block.
