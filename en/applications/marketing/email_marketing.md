# Email marketing

Emails are an effective, fully-customizable form of communication that are
able to reach any target audience - large or small. The success of an email is
easily measurable, especially when a creative call-to-action is involved.

Konvergo ERP _Email Marketing_ provides professional-grade email design tools,
templates, and features, designed to simplify the otherwise complex process
required to create engaging emails, build successful campaigns, and track
their overall effectiveness in a single application.

## Email marketing dashboard

To get started, click on the Email Marketing app icon, located on the main
Konvergo ERP dashboard, which leads to the main **Email Marketing** dashboard (in the
default kanban view).

To see all the mailings in the database, remove the default **My Mailings**
filter from the search bar.

![View of the main dashboard of the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/dashboard1.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>In the search bar, by default, the filter: <b>My Mailings</b> is present. That means the
only information being seen (at that time) on the <b>Email Marketing</b> dashboard are
emails that the current user has created, sent, or is responsible for.</p>
<p>This filter can be removed by clicking the <b>X</b> next to <b>My Mailings</b> in the
search bar. Doing so, reveals all the information for every email in the database.</p>
</div>

### Default kanban view and stages

The four kanban columns each represent the various stages of emails that have
been built or sent within the _Email Marketing_ application.

The stages are: **Draft** , **In Queue** , **Sending** , **Sent**.

  * **Draft** : means the email is still being written/created.

  * **In Queue** : means the email is scheduled, and sent at a later date.

  * **Sending** : means the email is currently being sent to its recipients.

  * **Sent** : means the email has already been sent to its recipients.

In each stage, there are drag-and-drop cards representing the email campaigns
that have been created, and the stage they are in represents the current
status of that mailing.

Each mailing block on the **Email Marketing** dashboard provides key
information related to that specific email.

When the cursor hovers over the upper-right corner of an email campaign card,
three vertical dots (**â‹®**) appear. When clicked, a mini drop-down menu
reveals the option to color-code the email **Delete** the email altogether, or
**Archive** the message for potential future use.

![View of the three-dot drop-down menu on the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
dashboard.](../../_images/three-dot-dropdown.png)

In the upper-right corner of the main **Email Marketing** dashboard, there are
other view options to choose from: **List** and **Graph**.

### List view

The **List** view (represented by the **â˜° (three vertical lines)** icon)
provides the same key information, but in a classic list format.

![How the List view appears in the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/list-view1.png)

### Graph view

The **Graph** view (represented by the **ðŸ“Š (bar graph)** icon) provides the
same key information, but in a variety of customizable graph (and chart)
layouts.

![How the Graph view appears in the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/graph-view.png)

In the upper-left corner, there is a **Measures** menu, providing even more
filter options to further customize the graph views.

Those **Measures** options are: **A/B Testing percentage** , **Color Index** ,
and **Count** (which is selected, by default).

### Filters, Group By, and Favorites search options

Regardless of the view chosen for the **Email Marketing** dashboard, the
**Filters** , **Group by** , and **Favorites** options are always available.

These options provide various ways to specify and organize the information
seen on the **Email Marketing** dashboard.

FiltersGroup ByFavorites

This drop-down menu provides different ways to filter email campaigns on the
dashboard. The options are: **My Mailings** , **Sent Date** , **Archived** ,
and **Add Custom Filter**. If **Add Custom Filter** is selected, Konvergo ERP reveals
an additional drop-down menu, with three customizable fields to fill in, in
order to retrieve results that fit more specific criteria.

![View of filters drop-down menu options on the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
dashboard.](../../_images/filters-dropdown.png)

This drop-down menu provides additional ways to organize the data on the
dashboard by grouping them in specific ways. Using this drop-down menu, the
data can be grouped by the messagesâ€™ **Status** , or who it was **Sent By**.

There is also the option to group the data by **Sent Period** , which has its
own sub-menu of options to choose from. The **Sent Period** options are
**Year** , **Quarter** , **Month** , **Week** , and **Day**.

If none of the above **Group By** options deliver the desired results, click
**Add Custom Group** at the bottom of the drop-down menu. Doing so reveals a
new field, wherein custom criteria can be selected and applied, thus
delivering any grouping of data that may be desired.

![View of the Group By drop-down menu on the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/group-by-dropdown.png)

This drop-down menu provides different ways to incorporate past search filters
and other record-related options to customize the dashboard. The options are:
**Save current search** , **Import records** , **Add to my dashboard** , and
**Add to Google Spreadsheet**.

![View of the Favorites drop-down menu on the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/favorites-dropdown.png)

## Settings

To view (and modify) the _Email Marketing_ settings, navigate to Email
Marketing application â€£ Configuration â€£ Settings.

![View of the Settings page in the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/settings-page.png)

On this **Settings** page, there are three features available. The features
are: **Mailing Campaigns** , **Blacklist Option when Unsubscribing** , and
**Dedicated Server**.

  * **Mailing Campaigns** : enables the option to manage mass mailing campaigns.

  * **Blacklist Option when Unsubscribing** : allows recipients to blacklist themselves from future mailings during the unsubscribing process.

  * **Dedicated Server** : provides the option to utilize a separate, dedicated server for mailings. When enabled, Konvergo ERP reveals a new field (and link), in which the specific server configurations must be entered, in order for it to connect properly to Konvergo ERP.

## Create an email

To create an email, open the Email Marketing application, and click the
**Create** button in the upper-left corner.

Clicking **Create** reveals a blank email detail form.

![View of a blank email detail form in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/blank-email-detail-form.png)

First, enter a **Subject** to the email. The **Subject** is visible in the
recipientsâ€™ inbox, allowing them to get quickly see what the message is about.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <b>Subject</b> field is mandatory. An email can not be sent without a
<b>Subject</b>.</p>
</div> <div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>The <b>â˜º (smiley face)</b> icon at the end of the <b>Subject</b> field (and
<b>Preview Text</b> field) represents emojis. Click that <b>â˜º (smiley face)</b> icon to
reveal a menu of emojis that can be used in either field.</p>
</div>

Next, there is the option to enter some **Preview Text**. This text is a
catchy preview sentence that encourages recipients to open the message. In
most inboxes, this is displayed next to the subject.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Keep the <b>Preview Text</b> empty to show the first characters of the email content,
instead.</p>
</div>

### Recipients

After that, itâ€™s time to choose the recipients of this email, which can be
completed in the **Recipients** field.

![View of recipients drop-down menu in the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/recipients-dropdown.png)

The default option is **Mailing List**. If **Mailing List** option is
selected, a specific **Mailing List** needs to be chosen from the adjacent
**Select mailing lists** field drop-down menu.

Then, Konvergo ERP will only send this email to contacts on that specific mailing
list.

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<p class="alert-title">
See also</p><p><a href="email_marketing/mailing_lists">Mailing lists</a></p>
</div>

When the **Recipients** field is clicked, a drop-down menu of other options is
revealed. Each option provides different ways Konvergo ERP can create a target
audience for the email.

Those options (excluding the default **Mailing List**) provide the option to
create a more specified recipient filter, in an equation-like format.

The **Recipients** field options are as follows:

  * **Applicant** : filter focuses on specific job applicants in the database.

  * **Contact** : filter focuses on specific contacts in the database.

  * **Event Registration** : filter focuses on people in the database who purchased event registrations.

  * **Event Track** : filter focuses on people in the database who hosted a specific talk (track) at an event.

  * **Lead/Opportunity** : filter focuses on leads or opportunities in the database.

  * **Mailing Contact** : filter focuses on specific mailing contacts in the database.

  * **Sales Order** : filter focuses on a specific sales orders in the database.

If the specified recipient fields donâ€™t automatically reveal themselves,
simply click the **Add Filter** button beneath the **Recipients** field, and
Konvergo ERP reveals the necessary equation fields to further drill down the target
recipients for this mailing.

### Add a recipient filter

To add a more specified recipient filter, select any recipient option (other
than **Mailing List**), and clicking **Add Filter** , if needed, to reveal
three fields, formatted like an equation.

To reveal the sub-menu options, click each field, and make the desired
selections, until the preferred configuration has been achieved. The number of
**Records** that match the rule(s) are indicated to the right of the
**Recipients** field, in green.

![View of how recipient filters can be customized in Konvergo ERP Email
Marketing.](../../_images/add-filter-button.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Some sub-menu options in the first rule field allow for a second choice to provide even more
specificity.</p>
</div>

To the right of each rule, are **Ã— (Delete node)** , **ï¼‹ (Add node)** , and
**â‹¯ (Add branch)** icons.

The **Ã— (Delete node)** icon deletes a specific node (line) of the rule. The
**ï¼‹ (Add node)** icon adds a node (line) to the rule. And, the **â‹¯ (Add
branch)** icon adds a branch to the node. A branch means two additional,
indented sub-nodes are added to the rule, providing even more specificity to
the line above it.

### Mail body tab

At the bottom of the email form are two tabs: **Mail Body** and **Settings**.
Letâ€™s focus on **Mail Body** tab first.

In the **Mail Body** tab, there are a number of pre-configured message
templates to choose from. Select the desired template, and modify every
element of its design details with Konvergo ERPâ€™s drag-and-drop building blocks,
located on the right sidebar. Each building block provides unique features and
professional design elements.

![View of the building blocks used to create mailings in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/mail-blocks.png) <div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>To build an email from scratch, select the <b>Plain Text</b> template, and Konvergo ERP provides a
blank email canvas, which can be customized in a number of ways - either by using the front-end
rich text editor that accepts slash (<b>/</b>) commands, or with the XML code editor when
<a href="../general/developer_mode#developer-mode"><span class="std std-ref">Developer Mode (debug mode)</span></a> is engaged, and the <b>&lt;/&gt;</b> icon is
clicked.</p>
</div>

### Settings tab

To the right of the **Mail Body** tab is the **Settings** tab.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The options available in the <b>Settings</b> tab will be different, depending on if the
<b>Mailing Campaigns</b> feature is activated in the <b>Settings</b> page of the
Email Marketing application (Email Marketing â€£ Configuration
â€£ Settings).</p>
</div>

Without the **Mailing Campaigns** feature activated, the **Settings** tab on
the email detail form looks like this:

![View of settings tab in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing app, without settings
activated.](../../_images/settings-without-features.png)

  * **Responsible** : choose an employee (in the database) to be responsible for this particular email.

  * **Send From** : designate an email alias thatâ€™ll display as the sender of this particular email.

  * **Reply To** : designate an email alias to whom all the replies to this particular email will be sent.

  * **Attachments** : if any specific documents are required (or helpful) for this event invite, they can be sent along with this email, by clicking **ATTACH A FILE** , and adding the appropriate document(s).

When the **Mailing Campaigns** feature _is_ activated, additional
**Marketing** options appear in the **Settings** tab, which look like this:

![View of settings tab in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing when settings are
activated.](../../_images/settings-tab-with-settings.png)

The additional features are: **Mailing Campaign** , **Allow A/B Testing** ,
and **A/B Testing percentage**.

## Mailing campaigns

The **Mailing Campaign** field provides the option to add this particular
email to a previously-made email campaign in the database. Click the empty
field to reveal a drop-down menu containing all previously-made mailing
campaigns in the database.

![View of a mailing campaign drop-down menu in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/mailing-campaign-dropdown.png)

If the desired campaign isnâ€™t available in the initial drop-down menu, select
**Search More** to reveal a complete list of all mailing campaigns in the
database. Or, type the name of the desired mailing campaign in the **Mailing
Campaign** field, until Konvergo ERP reveals the desired campaign in the drop-down
menu. Then, select the desired campaign.

### Create new mailing campaign (from Settings tab)

To create a new campaign from this **Mailing Campaign** field, start typing
the name of this new campaign, and select **Create [Campaign Name]** or
**Create and Editâ€¦**.

Click **Create** to add this new mailing campaign to the database, and modify
its settings in the future. And click **Create and Editâ€¦** to add this new
mailing campaign to the database, and Konvergo ERP reveals a pop-up window.

![View of the email mailing campaign pop-up window in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing
application.](../../_images/mailing-campaign-popup.png)

Here, the new mailing campaign can be further customized. Adjust the
**Campaign Name** , assign a **Responsible** , and add **Tags**.

The top row of the **Create: Mailing Campaign** pop-up window is filled with
analytical smart buttons. Each of which displays various metrics related to
the campaign. When clicked, Konvergo ERP reveals a separate, more detailed page with
even more in-depth statistics.

The option to instantly a new communication from this pop-up window is
available in the upper-left corner. The adjustable status bar is located in
the upper-right.

When all modifications are ready to be finalized, click **Save**. To delete
the entire campaign, click **Discard**.

### Create new mailing campaign (from Campaigns page)

When the **Mailing Campaigns** feature is activated, a new **Campaigns**
option appears in the header of the _Email Marketing_ application. Campaigns
can also be created on this **Campaigns** page in the _Email Marketing_ app.

To do that, navigate to Email Marketing app â€£ Campaigns â€£ Create. When thatâ€™s
clicked, a pop-up window appears, in which the **Campaign Name** ,
**Responsible** , and **Tags** can be added directly on the **Campaigns**
dashboard.

![View of the campaign pop-up window in Konvergo ERP Email
Marketing.](../../_images/campaigns-page-popup.png)

Click **Add** to add the campaign to the database, and freely edit it later
on. Or, click **Edit** and Konvergo ERP reveals the campaign template form on a
separate page, providing the opportunity to further edit the campaign, send
communications related to the campaign, and analyze various metrics related to
the campaign, via the smart buttons at the top of the form.

## A/B testing

Back in the **Settings** tab of the mailing, if the **Allow A/B Testing** box
is checked, recipients are only be mailed to once. This allows different
mailings to be sent to randomly selected recipients. This tests the overall
effectiveness of the mailing, and eliminates the need for duplicate messages.

The **A/B Testing percentage** field represents the percentage of contacts in
the database that this message will be mailed to, as a part of the **A/B
Testing**. Enter a number between `1-100`. The recipients are randomly chosen.

## Send, schedule, or test

After finalizing the mailing, Konvergo ERP provides the following options in the
upper-left corner of the email template page. Those options are: **Send** ,
**Schedule** , and **Test**.

While in **Edit** mode, there are also buttons to **Save** or **Discard** the
mailing, as well.

  * **Send** \- Click to have Konvergo ERP send the email to the desired recipients. When Konvergo ERP has sent the mailing, the status changes to _Sent_.

  * **Schedule** \- Click to reveal a pop-up window, in which a future date-time is chosen. Konvergo ERP sends the mailing to the desired recipients at that specified date-time. When a date-time is chosen, the status of the mailing changes to _In Queue_.

  * **Test** \- Click to reveal a pop-up window, in which Konvergo ERP allows a sample email to be sent for testing purposes. Enter the desired recipientâ€™s email address in the **Recipients** field, and click **Send Sample Mail**.

  * **Discard** \- Click to discard any changes that have been made since the last save.
