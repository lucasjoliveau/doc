# Campaign workflow activities

When creating a marketing campaign in the _Marketing Automation_ app, users
can plan marketing activities that can be triggered when certain actions or
inactions occur. These can be activities such as, automated emails, SMS, or
internal server actions.

## Add workflow activities

To add workflow activities to a marketing campaign, navigate to the bottom of
a pre-existing or new campaign detail form, beneath the target audience
configuration fields, and click **Add new activity**.

Doing so reveals a **Create Activities** pop-up window. This pop-up window is
a blank activity template, where specific parameters can be set for that
particular activity.

First, enter a name for the activity in the **Activity Name** field. Then,
proceed to configure the following options.

Once ready, either click: **Save & Close** to save the activity and close the
pop-up form, **Save & New** to save the activity and instantly create an
additional activity on a fresh **Create Activities** pop-up form, or
**Discard** to delete the activity.

### Activity types

Then, select the **Activity Type**. Choose between **Email** , **Server
Action** (an internal action within the database), or **SMS**.

The field below the **Activity Type** changes, depending on the chosen
**Activity Type**.

#### Email activity

If **Email** is the **Activity Type** , the option to choose a premade/pre-
configured **Mail Template** becomes available. A mail template can also be
created on-the-fly, as well.

To create a new template directly from the **Mail Template** field, start
typing the title of the new template into the blank field beside **Mail
Template** , and select **Create and edit…** to reveal a **Create Marketing
Template** pop-up window.

window.](../../../../_images/email-activity-create-edit.png)

In that pop-up window, proceed to create and configure the new email template.

#### Server action activity

If **Server Action** is the **Activity Type** , the option to choose a
specific **Server Action** (e.g. Message for sales person, Create Leads on
Website clicks, etc.) becomes available.

The option to create a new server action directly from the **Server Action**
is also available. To do that, type in the name of the new action, then click
**Create and Edit…** from the drop-down menu.

![The create and edit option in the server action field on campaign detail
form.](../../../../_images/server-action-create-edit-option.png)

Or, as an alternative, click the empty **Server Action** field to reveal a
drop-down menu, and select **Search More…** to reveal a **Search: Server
Action** pop-up window, containing all the pre-configured server action
options to choose from.

To create a new server action from this pop-up window, and click **New**.

![The new button found on a server action pop-up in Konvergo ERP marketing automation
application.](../../../../_images/search-server-action-new-button.png)

Either option reveals a blank **Create Server Action** pop-up, wherein a
custom server action can be created and configured.

#### SMS activity

If **SMS** is the **Activity Type** , the option to choose a premade/pre-
configured **SMS Template** becomes available. A SMS template can also be
created on-the-fly directly from this field.

To create a new template directly from the **SMS Template** field, start
typing the title of the new template into the blank field beside **SMS
Template** , and select **Create and edit…** from the drop-down menu.

![The create and edit email drop-down option on create activities pop-up
window.](../../../../_images/create-edit-sms-option.png)

Doing so reveals a **Create Marketing Template** pop-up window. In that pop-up
window, proceed to create and configure the new SMS template.

### Trigger

The **Trigger** field on the **Create Activities** pop-up form allows users to
choose when the designated workflow activity should be triggered.

Start by selecting a number in the top field. In the next **Trigger** field,
designate if it should be **Hours** , **Days** , **Weeks** , or **Months**.
Then, click the final field, where it reads **beginning of the workflow** be
default to reveal a a drop-down menu of other trigger options.

![A list of the trigger options available on the workflow activities pop-up
form.](../../../../_images/trigger-options-drop-down-menu.png)

The trigger options are as follows:

  * **beginning of the workflow** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time after the beginning of the entire workflow.

  * **another activity** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time after another specific activity in the workflow.

  * **Mail:opened** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent mail in the workflow has been opened by the recipient.

  * **Mail:not opened** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent mail in the workflow has not been opened by the recipient.

  * **Mail: replied** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent mail in the workflow has been replied to by the recipient.

  * **Mail: not replied** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent mail in the workflow has not been replied to by the recipient.

  * **Mail: clicked** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent mail in the workflow has been clicked by the recipient, after it’s been opened.

  * **Mail: not clicked** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent mail in the workflow has not been clicked by the recipient, after it’s been opened.

  * **Mail: bounced** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent mail in the workflow has been bounced back for any reason.

  * **SMS: clicked** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent SMS in the workflow has been clicked by the recipient, after it’s been opened.

  * **SMS: not clicked** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent SMS in the workflow has not been clicked by the recipient, after it’s been opened.

  * **SMS: bounced** : the activity will be triggered at the previously-configured time if the sent SMS in the workflow has been bounced back for any reason.

### Expiry duration

Next, on the **Create Activities** pop-up form is the **Expiry Duration**
option.

The **Expiry Duration** checkbox provides the option to configure the activity
to stop the actions after a specific amount of time (after the scheduled
date).

When selected, a **Cancel after** field appears, in which the number of
**Hours, Days, Weeks, or Months** can be configured for the actions to cease
after the initial date.

pop-up form.](../../../../_images/expiry-duration-field-options.png)

### Activity and applied filters

Moving down into the **Domain** section of the **Create Activities** pop-up
form, there is the **Activity Filter** and **Applied Filter** fields.

The **Activity Filter** field provides the option to configure a recipient
filter domain that applies to this activity _and_ its child activities. In
works in the same fashion as a typical target audience filter.

To add an activity filter, click **Add condition** in the **Activity Filter**
field and proceed to configure a custom activity filter equation rule(s).

![How to add an activity filter to a workflow activity in Konvergo ERP Marketing
Automation.](../../../../_images/activity-filter-option.png)

This option is not a required field. If left alone, the activity applies to
all records related to the target audience of the overall campaign.

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<p class="alert-title">
See also</p><ul>
<li><p><a href="target_audience">Target an audience</a></p></li>
</ul>
</div>

The **Applied Filter** field is non-configurable. It’s simply a summary of
when the activity will be performed, _only_ if it satisfies the specified
domain (e.g. the rules configured in the **Activity Filter** field).

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>After the activity’s settings are fully configured, click <b>Save &amp; Close</b> to save the
activity and return to the marketing automation campaign form, <b>Save &amp; New</b> to save the
activity and immediately create another one in a fresh <b>Create Activities</b> pop-up
window, or <b>Discard</b> to delete the activity and return to the marketing automation
campaign form.</p>
</div>

## Workflow activity

Once an activity is created and saved, it appears as an activity card in the
**Workflow** section, located at the bottom of the marketing automation
campaign form. The analytics related to each activity is displayed as a line
graph.

![Typical workflow activity in Konvergo ERP Marketing
Automation.](../../../../_images/workflow-activity.png)

The configured **Trigger** time for that activity can be found to the left of
the **Workflow Activity** card in the **Workflow** section.

Once the activity has been triggered, a figure representing the number of
**Success** or **Rejected** activities will be displayed to the right of the
graph.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>If the <b>Activity Type</b> of the activity is set to <b>Email</b> or <b>SMS</b>,
there are more in-depth analytics beneath the activity graph data, detailing how many messages
have been <b>Sent</b>, and what percentage of those have been <b>Clicked</b>,
<b>Replied</b> to, or <b>Bounced</b>.</p>
</div>

## Child activities

There is also the option to add a _child activity_ by clicking **Add child
activity** , located at the bottom of each activity block in the **Workflow**
section of a marketing campaign form.

Child activities are sub-activities that are connected to and triggered by the
activity above it, which is known as its _parent activity_. A child activity
is easy to recognize, as its slightly indented beneath its parent activity.

![A typical child activity indented beneath its parent
activity.](../../../../_images/indented-child-activity.png)

Konvergo ERP provides a number of triggering options to launch a child activity - all
of which depend on the trigger configurations related to its parent activity.
Under the desired parent activity, hover over **Add child activity** , to
reveal a menu of child activity trigger options.

![The various child activity trigger options in the workflow section of a
campaign.](../../../../_images/child-activity-trigger-options.png)

Select any of the following child activity triggers:

  * **Add Another Activity** : instantly adds another activity.

  * **Opened** : the next activity will be triggered if the recipient opens the mailing.

  * **Not Opened** : the next activity will be triggered if the recipient does not open the mailing.

  * **Replied** : the next activity will be triggered if the recipient replies to the mailing.

  * **Not Replied** : the next activity will be triggered if the recipient does not reply to the mailing.

  * **Clicked** : the next activity will be triggered if the recipient clicks on a link included in the mailing.

  * **Not Clicked** : the next activity will be triggered if the recipient does not click on a link included in the mailing.

  * **Bounced** : the next activity will be triggered if the mailing is bounced (not sent).

Once a trigger is selected, the user can configure the child activity the same
way they would for a regular workflow activity.
