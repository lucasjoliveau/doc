# Target an audience

Delivering marketing campaigns to the right audience is paramount when trying
to grow a business. The Konvergo ERP _Marketing Automation_ application helps
marketers to do just that by providing detailed filtering tools, which can be
as simple (or as complex) as necessary, to reach the right customers at the
right time.

## Configure target filters

When configuring the target filters on a marketing campaign, there are some
options that have an **> (arrow)** icon beside them. The **> (arrow)** icon
signifies that the particular filter has more refined parameters within it
that can be customized.

application.](../../../../_images/marketing-filters.png)

Filters can be extended by adding _branches_ and _nodes_. A _node_ adds
another filtering parameter to a group of targeting conditions (e.g. a new
line), and a _branch_ creates a narrowly refined cluster of parameters,
allowing filters to be grouped with **ANY** or **ALL** statements.

Every time a new branch is created, there are two options:

  * Either the records can match **ALL** criteria for the upcoming rules (creating an AND statement where _all_ criteria must match).

  * Or, the records can match **ANY** criteria for the upcoming rules (creating an OR statement where _only one_ of the criteria must match).

To change between these two options, simply click the drop-down arrow icon in
the green box and select **ANY** or **ALL**.

To add a node, click on the **‚ûï (plus sign)** icon, and to add another branch
click on the **‚ãØ (ellipses)** icon. To exclude a node or a branch, click on
**‚úñ (delete)** icon to delete it.

## Use cases

The following scenarios outline different combinations of filters a marketing
campaign might commonly use.

### Scenario #1: Narrow target down to new opportunities in the pipeline

While in _Edit mode_ on a campaign template form (by clicking the **Edit**
button), select the **Target** field, and click **Search More** from the drop-
down menu. Then, search for **Lead/Opportunity** , and select it.

Next, click **Add Filter** in the **Filter** field. Then, click on the default
**ID** filter option in the first portion of the filter equation. Doing so
reveals a drop-down menu full of filter options. From this drop-down, scroll
down (or search for) **Type**.

Keep the second portion of the filter equation on the default **üü∞ (equal
sign)** icon.

Next, change the third (and final) portion of the filter equation from
**Lead** to **Opportunity**. The number of **Records** that fit this specific
filter equation changes as the equation is customized.

Add another node to this filter by clicking the **‚ûï (plus sign)** icon to the
right of the equation.

With ‚Äúnew‚Äù opportunities being the target of this filter, the second node will
focus on _only_ locating opportunities that are in the **New** stage of the
pipeline. To do that, select the default **ID** from the first portion of the
second filter equation, and scroll down (or search for) **Stage** from the
field drop-down menu.

Once again, leave the second portion of the filter equation on **üü∞ (equal
sign)** icon.

Lastly, highlight the default value in the third (and final) portion of the
second filter equation, and type in `New`. With that in place, Konvergo ERP only
targets opportunities that are in the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù stage of the pipeline.

### Scenario #2: Narrow down target to event attendees who purchased a
specific ticket

While in _Edit mode_ on a campaign template form (by clicking the **Edit**
button), select the **Target** field, and click **Search More** from the drop-
down menu. Then, scroll down (or search for) **Event** , and select it.

Next, click **Add Filter** in the **Filter** field. Click on the default
**ID** filter option in the first portion of the filter equation. Doing so
reveals a drop-down menu full of filter options. From this drop-down, scroll
down (or search for) **Event**.

Click the default **üü∞ (equal sign)** icon in the second portion of the filter
equation. This reveals a drop-down menu. From this drop-down menu, select
**contains**.

In the third (and final) empty portion of the filter equation, type in the
name of the event(s) that Konvergo ERP should consider for this campaign filter.

Then, add another node to this filter by clicking the **‚ûï (plus sign)** icon
to the right of the equation.

The second node will focus on targeting this campaign to attendees who
purchase a specific type of ticket to the aforementioned event(s) mentioned in
the first filter equation.

To do that, select the default **ID** from the first portion of the second
filter equation, and scroll down (or search for) **Event Ticket** from the
field drop-down menu. Then, in that same drop-down menu, select **Name**.

Once again, click the default **üü∞ (equal sign)** icon in the second portion of
the filter equation, and select **contains**.

Lastly, in the third (and final) portion of the second filter equation, which
is blank, type in the name of the ticket type that should be used for the
filter. In this case, **Standard** is the name of the event ticket type for
this sample filter.
