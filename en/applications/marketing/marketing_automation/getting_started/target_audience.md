# Target an audience

Delivering marketing campaigns to the right audience is paramount when trying
to grow a business. The Odoo _Marketing Automation_ application helps
marketers to do just that by providing detailed filtering tools, which can be
as simple (or as complex) as necessary, to reach the right customers at the
right time.

## Configure target filters

When configuring the target filters on a marketing campaign, there are some
options that have an > (arrow) icon beside them. The > (arrow) icon signifies
that the particular filter has more refined parameters within it that can be
customized.

application.](../../../../_images/marketing-filters.png)

Filters can be extended by adding _branches_ and _nodes_. A _node_ adds
another filtering parameter to a group of targeting conditions (e.g. a new
line), and a _branch_ creates a narrowly refined cluster of parameters,
allowing filters to be grouped with ANY or ALL statements.

Every time a new branch is created, there are two options:

  * Either the records can match ALL criteria for the upcoming rules (creating an AND statement where _all_ criteria must match).

  * Or, the records can match ANY criteria for the upcoming rules (creating an OR statement where _only one_ of the criteria must match).

To change between these two options, simply click the drop-down arrow icon in
the green box and select ANY or ALL.

To add a node, click on the ➕ (plus sign) icon, and to add another branch
click on the ⋯ (ellipses) icon. To exclude a node or a branch, click on ✖
(delete) icon to delete it.

## Use cases

The following scenarios outline different combinations of filters a marketing
campaign might commonly use.

### Scenario #1: Narrow target down to new opportunities in the pipeline

While in _Edit mode_ on a campaign template form (by clicking the Edit
button), select the Target field, and click Search More from the drop-down
menu. Then, search for Lead/Opportunity, and select it.

Next, click Add Filter in the Filter field. Then, click on the default ID
filter option in the first portion of the filter equation. Doing so reveals a
drop-down menu full of filter options. From this drop-down, scroll down (or
search for) Type.

Keep the second portion of the filter equation on the default 🟰 (equal sign)
icon.

Next, change the third (and final) portion of the filter equation from Lead to
Opportunity. The number of Records that fit this specific filter equation
changes as the equation is customized.

Add another node to this filter by clicking the ➕ (plus sign) icon to the
right of the equation.

With “new” opportunities being the target of this filter, the second node will
focus on _only_ locating opportunities that are in the New stage of the
pipeline. To do that, select the default ID from the first portion of the
second filter equation, and scroll down (or search for) Stage from the field
drop-down menu.

Once again, leave the second portion of the filter equation on 🟰 (equal sign)
icon.

Lastly, highlight the default value in the third (and final) portion of the
second filter equation, and type in `New`. With that in place, Odoo only
targets opportunities that are in the “New” stage of the pipeline.

### Scenario #2: Narrow down target to event attendees who purchased a
specific ticket

While in _Edit mode_ on a campaign template form (by clicking the Edit
button), select the Target field, and click Search More from the drop-down
menu. Then, scroll down (or search for) Event, and select it.

Next, click Add Filter in the Filter field. Click on the default ID filter
option in the first portion of the filter equation. Doing so reveals a drop-
down menu full of filter options. From this drop-down, scroll down (or search
for) Event.

Click the default 🟰 (equal sign) icon in the second portion of the filter
equation. This reveals a drop-down menu. From this drop-down menu, select
contains.

In the third (and final) empty portion of the filter equation, type in the
name of the event(s) that Odoo should consider for this campaign filter.

Then, add another node to this filter by clicking the ➕ (plus sign) icon to
the right of the equation.

The second node will focus on targeting this campaign to attendees who
purchase a specific type of ticket to the aforementioned event(s) mentioned in
the first filter equation.

To do that, select the default ID from the first portion of the second filter
equation, and scroll down (or search for) Event Ticket from the field drop-
down menu. Then, in that same drop-down menu, select Name.

Once again, click the default 🟰 (equal sign) icon in the second portion of the
filter equation, and select contains.

Lastly, in the third (and final) portion of the second filter equation, which
is blank, type in the name of the ticket type that should be used for the
filter. In this case, Standard is the name of the event ticket type for this
sample filter.
