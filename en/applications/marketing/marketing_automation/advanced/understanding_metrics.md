# Campaign metrics

_Campaign metrics_ are detailed statistics and analytics within a marketing
campaign, measuring its success and effectiveness. Triggered marketing
activities populate relevant activity blocks with real-time metrics, in the
campaign detail form.

## Activity analytics

In the Workflow section of a campaign detail form in the _Marketing
Automation_ app, where the various campaign activities are located, a
collection of useful data can be found on every individual activity block,
like number of communications Sent, percentage of messages that have been
Clicked, and more.

Odoo.](../../../../_images/activity-analytics-block-sample.png)

To the left of the activity block, the configured [trigger
time](../getting_started/workflow_activities.html) is displayed as a duration
(either Hours, Days, Weeks, or Months) if it corresponds to period after the
workflow begins.

Note

If the trigger time is dependent on another activity or triggering action
(e.g. Mail: Replied, etc.) the time is displayed, along with the necessary
action for that activity to be activated (e.g. `Replied after 2 Hours`).

Automation.](../../../../_images/replied-after-activity-time-trigger.png)

In the activity block, an icon represents each activity type. An ✉️ (envelope)
icon means the activity is an email. Three tiny, interlocking ⚙️ (gear) icons
means the activity is an internal action. And, a small, basic 📱 (mobile) icon
means the activity is an SMS.

Tip

The activity type name is also displayed in smaller font below the activity
title.

Beside the activity icon, at the top of the activity block, is the title of
the activity. To the right of the activity title, there are Edit and Delete
buttons.

Click Edit to open the Open: Activities pop-up form for that specific
activity, in which that activity can be modified. Click the Delete button to
completely delete that specific activity from the workflow.

### Activity graph tab

In every activity block, the Graph (pie chart icon) tab is open by default,
displaying related metrics as a simple line graph. The success metrics are
represented in `green` and the rejected metrics are represented in `red`.

Numerical representations of both Success and Rejected activities are shown to
the right of the line graph.

Tip

Hovering over any point in the line graph of the activity block reveals a
notated breakdown of data for that specific date.

Beneath the graph in the activity block, for _Email_ or _SMS_ activity types,
a line of accessible data figures provide a bird’s eye view of the campaign
activity, including: Sent (numerical), Clicked (percentage), Replied
(percentage), and Bounced (percentage).

Tip

Clicking any of those stats on the DETAILS line, beneath the line graph,
reveals a separate page containing every specific record for that particular
data point.

### Activity filter tab

Next to the Graph tab on the activity block, there’s the option to open a
Filter tab (represented by a filter/funnel icon).

Automation.](../../../../_images/activity-filter-tab.png)

Clicking the Filter tab on an activity block, reveals what the specific
filters are for that particular campaign activity, and how many records in the
database match that specific criteria.

Tip

Clicking the records link beneath the displayed filter reveals a separate pop-
up window containing a list of all the records that match that specific
campaign activity rule(s).

URLs, navigate to Marketing Automation app ‣ Reporting ‣ Link Tracker. Doing
