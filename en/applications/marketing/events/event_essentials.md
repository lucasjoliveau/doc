# Event essentials

Konvergo ERP Events provides event coordinators with an arsenal of planning,
communications, and reporting tools to create immersive and engaging
experiences for customers. Namely, staff can create and publish events on
their website, sell tickets online, scan tickets with Konvergo ERP barcode, send out
automated emails, and generate rich reporting data once the event accepts
registrations.

## Kanban concepts and organization

To get started, click on the **Events** application on the home dashboard,
which then leads to the kanban view populated with a variety of pipeline
stages. Key information is listed on each event card, such as the date/time of
the event, along with the number of expected (and confirmed) attendees.

To create a new stage, click **Add a Column** and provide a befitting title to
reflect the purpose of that stage.

To reorganize the stages, just drag-and-drop them until they are in the
correct order. Stages can also be “folded” in the kanban for a cleaner
presentation, via the **Settings** menu to the right of each stage’s title,
which is represented by a gear icon.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The gear icon, by default, is hidden and will appear next to the  <b>+</b> icon when moused
over.</p>
</div>

When clicked, a drop-down menu of settings will appear.

## Create a new event

To create an event, click **Create** from the Events dashboard. Konvergo ERP will then
direct the page to a blank event template form.

From the event form, fill out the necessary fields, either by choosing from
existing data in the Konvergo ERP database or by creating and editing new field data.
Key information to enter for the event includes:

  * **Event Name** : give the event a title.

  * **Date** : includes the start and end dates/times for the event.

  * **Timezone** : covers the timezone for when the event is taking place.

  * **Template** : choose from a pre-built event template or build a custom one and connect it here.

  * **Tags** : add tags to indicate briefly what the event is for (e.g. `tradeshow`). Tags help better organize event cards in the kanban and are useful when using search filters during reporting periods.

  * **Organizer** : detail the organizer(s) for the event. This field is usually the company that owns the Konvergo ERP database, or a vendor.

  * **Responsible** : name the point person who is responsible for organizing the event.

  * **Website** : indicate which Konvergo ERP website(s) the event event should be published to.

  * **Venue** : list the venue details here if it’s a new record, or choose from an existing location.

  * **Limit Registrations** : when enabled, this setting caps the attendee registrations to a specified amount

  * **Autoconfirmation** : when enabled, this setting skips the confirmation request that gets sent by email to event registrants, and automatically confirms their registration.

Once the fields in the event form are set, move on to the **Tickets** and
**Communication** tabs, and optionally the **Questions** tab if registrations
should require additional information.

### Add and sell event tickets

Under the **Tickets** tab, add line items for each type of ticket the event
plans to offer. Here, determine the ticket price, start/end dates for
registrations, as well as the maximum number of tickets that can be sold.

If selling tickets isn’t necessary for the event, a simple **Registration**
button will be displayed on the event’s page by default.

tab.png)

### Send automated emails, text, and social posts to event attendees

Under the **Communication** tab, configure personalized email, SMS, or social
post messages to keep in touch with event attendees. For each communication,
click **Add a line** in the **Communication** tab form, and then choose (or
create) a communications template using the drop-down menu under the
**Template** column.

Next, define the **Interval** and **Unit** of time for how often the
communication should be sent; use these time fields to specify the frequency
of **Hours** , **Days** , **Weeks** , or **Months** communications should be
sent. There is also the option to send communications `Immediately` after a
specified **Trigger** is activated.

In the last column, determine the **Trigger** which controls how and when the
communication is sent. For this action, choose between: **Before the event** ,
**After each registration** , or **After the event**.

communication-tab.png)

### Attach a questionnaire to event registrations

Implementing a questionnaire during event sign up is an effective way to gauge
the wants, needs, and interests of the event’s attendees ahead of time.
Questionnaires also act as informative analytics tools for reporting periods
before (or after) events take place.

To create a questionnaire, from the **Events** application, navigate to
Configuration ‣ Settings and then enable the **Questions** setting.

With the setting enabled, questions and answers can now be added (and
recorded) under the the **Questions** tab back on the event form. For each
question, specify if it should only be asked once with the **Ask once per
order** checkbox, or if the question requires a **Mandatory Answer** , which
will make the question required for registration.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>If the <b>Once per order</b> checkbox is enabled, then a single registration for 3 event
attendees will show the questionnaire only once.</p>
</div>

There are two **Question Types** to choose from: **Selection** and **Text
Input**. The **Selection** type, allows attendees to select an answer from
pre-configured options, which are entered in the **Answers** tab below. The
**Text Input** type allows attendees to write in their own answer to the
question in a text box.

![View of an event form, open the questions tab, and add a
question.](../../../_images/events-questions-tab.png)

### Log internal notes or add ticket instructions

In the **Notes** tab, there is the option to add a **Note** and/or **Ticket
instructions**.

Under **Note** , internal notes can be left (such as: to-do lists, contact
information, etc.) for event staff to reference. In the **Ticket
instructions** field, helpful information for staff and attendees can be
shared (like, directions to the venue, opening/closing times, etc.)

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Type <code>/</code> in either text field (<b>Note</b> or <b>Ticket instructions</b>) to reveal a
sub-menu of <b>Structure</b> options. These options provide various formatting options to
ensure vital internal information is organized for event staff to review.</p>
</div> ![View of the Notes tab in Konvergo ERP
Events.](../../../_images/events-notes-tab.png)

## Invite attendees to the event

To invite people to an event, click the **Invite** button located in the top
left corner of the event form.

Inside the invite template form, are options to sent email or SMS invites.
Each message can be fully customized, and recipients can be added.

Adding a **Subject** line for the invite message is required, but the
**Preview Text** field is optional. The **Preview Text** is a catchy preview
sentence meant to encourage recipients to open the email.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>In most cases, the <b>Preview Text</b> is displayed next to the subject. Keep this field
empty to ensure the first characters of the email content appear, instead.</p>
</div>

### Select invitees and configure recipient filters

In the middle of the invitation form, find and click the **Recipients** field,
to reveal a drop-down menu of recipient options. These choices represent where
Konvergo ERP will find the desired recipients’ information.

Once an option from this menu is selected (e.g. **Applicant** , **Contact** ,
**Event Registration** , **Lead/Opportunity** , etc.), Konvergo ERP will send the
invitation to all recipients who match that initial rule. Additional rules can
be added to narrow down the target recipients, by clicking **Add Filter**.

![View of the add filter button beneath the recipients field in Konvergo ERP
Events.](../../../_images/add-filter-button1.png)

Clicking **Add Filter** reveals three fields, formatted like an equation. To
reveal the sub-menu options, click each field, and make the desired
selections, until the preferred configuration has been acheived. The number of
**Records** that match the rule(s) are indicated to the right of the
**Recipients** field, in green.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Some sub-menu options in the first rule field allow for a second choice to provide even more
specificity.</p>
</div>

To the right of each rule, are **x** , **+** , and **…** icons. The **x** icon
deletes a specific node (line) of the rule. The **+** icon adds a node (line)
to the rule. And, the **…** icon adds a branch to the node. A branch means two
additional, indented sub-nodes are added to the rule, providing even more
specificity to the line above it.

### Build a custom event invite

In the **Mail Body** tab, there are a number of pre-configured message
templates to choose from. Select the desired template, and modify every
element of its design details with Konvergo ERP’s drag-and-drop web builder, located
on the right sidebar.

![View of the drag and drop building blocks used to customize event invite
emails.](../../../_images/event-email-builder-block.gif) <div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>To build an email event invite from scratch, select the <b>Plain Text</b> template, and
Konvergo ERP will provide a blank email canvas, which can be customized either by using the frontend
rich text editor that accepts slash (<code>/</code>) commands, or the XML code editor when <a href="../../general/developer_mode#developer-mode"><span class="std std-ref">developer
mode</span></a> is engaged and the <b>&lt;/&gt;</b> icon is pressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <b>Mail Body</b> tab (and template options), are only available if the event invite
<b>Mailing Type</b> is designated as an <b>Email</b>. If <b>SMS</b> is the
<b>Mailing Type</b>, a <b>SMS Content</b> tab (consisting of a blank text space), is
available, instead.</p>
</div>

### Modify event invite settings

The options under the **Settings** tab are different, depending on the
specified **Mailing Type**.

If the **Email** option is selected as the **Mailing Type** , an employee can
be designated as the **Responsible** , meaning that person is the one
responsible for this particular invite message. **Send From** and **Reply To**
email aliases can be designated here, as well.

Also, if any specific documents are required (or helpful) for this event
invite, they can be sent along with this email, by clicking **ATTACH A FILE**
, and adding the appropriate document(s).

If the **SMS** option is selected as the **Mailing Type** , a **Responsible**
can be designated, and the option to **Include an opt-out link** is available.

### Send event invitations to recipients

If the selected **Mailing Type** is **Email** , there are three options to
send the invite: **Send** , **Schedule** , and **Test**.

The **Send** option sends the invite right away. The **Schedule** option
reveals a pop-up, in which a scheduled date/time can be selected for the email
to be sent. The **Test** option reveals a **Test Mailing** pop-up, where
specific recipient email addresses can be entered for Konvergo ERP to send them the
current version of the mailing for review before officially sending it out to
prospective event attendees.

If the selected **Mailing Type** is **SMS** , there are four options to send
the invite: **Put in Queue** , **Send Now** , **Schedule** , and **Test**.

The **Put in Queue** option schedules an SMS message to all recipients (that
match the designated rules, if any) in the near future. Clicking **Put in
Queue** reveals a pop-up, requiring confirmation. When confirmed, a blue
banner appears on the event invite template form, indicating that the SMS will
be sent later that day.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <b>Send Now</b>, <b>Schedule</b>, and <b>Test</b> options all function the
same way for both <b>Mailing Type</b> options.</p>
</div>

## Publish events

Until an event is published, it will remain hidden from public view on the
website and registering for it will not be possible. To publish an event,
navigate to it either from the backend of Konvergo ERP through the **Events**
application, or access the hidden event page through the frontend as either a
priveliged user or administrator.

If navigating from the backend, go to the event form, and click the **Go to
Website** smart button to reach the event page on the website (on the
frontend). If starting from the frontend , simply navigate to the event page
that needs to be published.

No matter the route, an event page can only be published from the frontend. In
the upper right corner of the event page on the website, toggle the switch
from the red **Unpublished** status to the green **Published** status. Doing
so instantly makes the event page accessible to the public on the website.
