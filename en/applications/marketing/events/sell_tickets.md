# Sell tickets

Create custom ticket tiers (with various price points) for potential attendees
to choose from, directly on the event template form, under the Tickets tab.
Odoo simplifies the ticket-purchasing process by providing plenty of payment
method options.

## Configuration

First, in order to enable the creation (and selling of) event tickets, go to
Configuration ‣ Settings, then enable the Tickets and Online Ticketing
features.

The Tickets feature allows tickets to be sold for an event.

The Online Tickets feature allows for the sale of tickets to occur through the
website.

Note

If these options are _not_ enabled, a default Register button will be
available for free registrations.

## Sell tickets through sales orders

In the Sales application, choose a previously-created Event Registration (as
if it were a product), and add it as a product line. Upon adding the
registration, a pop-up appears, which allows for the selection of a specific
event (and ticket tier). That specific event ticket is then attached to the
sales order.

Events with tickets sold online or through sales orders have a Sales Smart
Button shortcut, located at the top of the event template form (in the Events
application).

Clicking the Sales Smart Button reveals a page with all the sales orders
related to that event.

## Sell tickets through the website

With tickets purchased through the website, the process is similar to creating
a Sales Order with a specific Registration product. Here, tickets are added to
a virtual cart, and the transaction can be completed as usual - utilizing any
of the pre-configured payment methods options that have been set up on the
website.

The completed purchase is automatically produced in a Sales Order, which can
be easily accessed in the back end of the database.
