# Sell tickets

Create custom ticket tiers (with various price points) for potential attendees
to choose from, directly on the event template form, under the **Tickets**
tab. Konvergo ERP simplifies the ticket-purchasing process by providing plenty of
payment method options.

## Configuration

First, in order to enable the creation (and selling of) event tickets, go to
Configuration â€£ Settings, then enable the **Tickets** and **Online Ticketing**
features.

The **Tickets** feature allows tickets to be sold for an event.

The **Online Tickets** feature allows for the sale of tickets to occur through
the website.

## Sell tickets through sales orders

In the **Sales** application, choose a previously-created Event Registration
(as if it were a product), and add it as a product line. Upon adding the
registration, a pop-up appears, which allows for the selection of a specific
event (and ticket tier). That specific event ticket is then attached to the
sales order.

Events with tickets sold online or through sales orders have a **Sales Smart
Button** shortcut, located at the top of the event template form (in the
**Events** application).

Clicking the **Sales Smart Button** reveals a page with all the sales orders
related to that event.

## Sell tickets through the website

With tickets purchased through the website, the process is similar to creating
a **Sales Order** with a specific **Registration** product. Here, tickets are
added to a virtual cart, and the transaction can be completed as usual -
utilizing any of the pre-configured payment methods options that have been set
up on the website.

The completed purchase is automatically produced in a **Sales Order** , which
can be easily accessed in the back end of the database.
