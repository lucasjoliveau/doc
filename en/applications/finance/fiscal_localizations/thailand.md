### Withholding PND tax report

Note</p><p>Withholding corporate income tax returns (domestic) is the tax used in case the company has
withheld the tax from ‚Äú<b>Personal (PND3)</b>‚Äù or ‚Äú<b>Corporate (PND53)</b>‚Äù services provided such as
rental, hiring, transportation, insurance, management fee, consulting, etc.</p>
</div>

The PND tax report allows users to generate a CSV file for bills to upload on
the [RDprep for Thailand e-Filling application](https://efiling.rd.go.th/rd-
cms/).

To generate a PND CSV file, go to Accounting ‚Ä£ Reporting ‚Ä£ Tax Report, select
a specific time or time range on the tax report, and click **PND3** or
**PND53**.

This generates the `Tax Report PND3.csv` and `Tax Report PND53.csv` files that
lists all the vendor bill lines with the applicable withholding tax.
