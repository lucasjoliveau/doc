## Taxes

Default Belgian taxes are created automatically when the Belgium - Accounting
and the Belgium - Accounting Reports modules are installed. Each tax impacts
the Belgian Tax Report, available by going to Accounting ‣ Reporting ‣
Statements Reports: Tax Report.

In Belgium, the standard VAT rate is **21%** , but there are lower rates for
some categories of goods and services. An intermediate rate of **12%** is
applied on social housing and food served in restaurants, while a reduced rate
of **6%** applies to most basic goods, such as food, water supply, books, and
medicine. A **0%** rate applies to some exceptional goods and services, such
as some daily and weekly publications, as well as recycled goods.

### Non-deductible taxes

In Belgium, some taxes are not fully deductible, such as taxes on the
maintenance of cars. This means a part of these taxes is considered as an
expense.

In Odoo, you can configure non-deductible taxes by creating tax rules for
these taxes and linking them to the corresponding accounts. This way, the
system automatically calculates the taxes and allocates them to the
appropriate accounts.

To configure a new non-deductible tax, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣
Accounting: Taxes, and click New:

  1. Add a line and select Base in the Based On column;

  2. Add a line, then select on tax in the Based on column and enter the **non-deductible** percentage in the % column;

  3. On the of tax line, select the Tax Grid(s) related to your tax;

  4. Add a line with the **deductible** percentage in the % column;

  5. Set of tax in Based On;

  6. Select 411000 VAT recoverable as account, and select the related tax grid.

Once you have created a non-deductible tax, you can apply it to your
transactions by selecting the appropriate tax during the encoding of bills and
credit notes. The system automatically calculates the tax amount and allocates
it to the corresponding accounts based on the tax rules configured.

Example

With the Belgian localization, the **21% car** tax is created by default (50%
non-deductible).

### Disallowed expenses report

**Disallowed expenses** are expenses that can be deducted from your accounting
result but not from your fiscal result.

The **disallowed expenses report** is available by going to Accounting ‣
Reporting ‣ Management: Disallowed Expenses. It allows financial results in
real-time, and periodic changes. This report is generated based on the
**disallowed expenses categories** that you can reach by going to Accounting ‣
Configuration ‣ Management: Disallowed Expenses Categories. Some categories
already exist by default but do not have any rates. Click on Set Rates to
update a specific category.

Tip

  * You can add multiple rates for various dates. In that case, the rate used to calculate the expense depends on the date at which it is calculated, and the rate set for that date.

  * If you have the **Fleet** app installed, tick the Car Category box when applicable. This makes the vehicle mandatory while booking a vendor bill.

To link a disallowed expenses category with a specific account, go to
Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Acounting: Chart of Accounts. Find the account
you want, and click on Setup. Add the Disallowed Expense category in the
Disallowed Expenses field. From now, when an expense is created with this
account, the disallowed expense is calculated based on the rate mentioned in
the Disallowed Expense category.

Let’s take an example reflecting **restaurant** and **car expenses**.

#### Restaurant expenses

In Belgium, 31% of **restaurant** expenses are non-deductible. Create a new
**disallowed expenses category** and set both Related Account(s) and Current
Rate.

![Disallowed expenses categories](../../../_images/restaurant-expenses.png)

#### Car expenses: vehicle split

In Belgium, the deductible percentage varies from car to car and, therefore,
should be indicated for each vehicle. To do so, open Fleet and select a
vehicle. In the Tax info tab, go to the Disallowed Expenses Rate section and
click on Add a line. Add a Start Date and a %. The amounts go in the same
account for all car expenses.

When you create a bill for car expenses, you can link each expense to a
specific car by filling the Vehicle column, so the right percentage is
applied.

![Disallowed expenses categories](../../../_images/car-bill.png)

The vehicle split option available in the disallowed expenses report allows
you to see the rate and disallowed amount for each car.

![Disallowed expenses categories](../../../_images/vehicle-split.png)

## Fee form 281.50 and form 325

### Fee form 281.50

Annually, a **281.50 fee form** must be reported to the fiscal authorities. To
do so, the tag `281.50` must be added on the **contact form** of the entities
concerned by the **281.50** fee. To add the tag, open Contacts, select the
person or company you want to create a **281.50 fee form** for, and add the
`281.50` tag in the Tags field.

![add the tag 281.50 on a contact form](../../../_images/281-50.png)

Note

Make sure the **street, zip code, country** , and **VAT number** are also
informed on the **Contact form**.

Then, depending on the nature of the expense, add the corresponding `281.50`
tag on the impact accounts. To do so, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣
Accounting: Chart of Accounts, and click on Setup to add the corresponding
`281.50` tag on the impacted accounts, i.e., 281.50 - Commissions, depending
on the nature of the expense.

### Form 325

You can create a **325 form** by going to Accounting ‣ Reporting ‣ Belgium:
Create 325 form. A new page pops up: select the right options and click
Generate 325 form. To open an already generated **325 form** , go to
Accounting ‣ Reporting ‣ Belgium: Open 325 forms.

![Add the tag 281-50 on a contact form](../../../_images/325-form.png)

## CODA and SODA statements

### CODA

**CODA** is an electronic XML format used to import Belgian bank statements.
You can download CODA files from your bank and import them directly into Odoo
by clicking Import Statement from your Bank journal on your dashboard.

![Import CODA files](../../../_images/coda-import.png)

Note

The Belgium - Import Bank CODA Statements module is installed by default when
the Belgium - Accounting and the Belgium - Accounting Reports modules are
installed.

[Import bank statements
files](../accounting/bank/transactions.html#transactions-import)

### SODA

**SODA** is an electronic XML format used to import accounting entries related
to salaries. SODA files can be imported into the journal you use to record
salaries by going to your Accounting **dashboard** and clicking Upload in the
related journal card form.

Once your **SODA** files are imported, the entries are created automatically
in your ‘salary’ journal.

![Import SODA files](../../../_images/soda-import.png)

## Electronic invoicing

Odoo supports the **E-FFF** and **Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 (UBL)** electronic
invoicing formats. To enable them, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Journals
‣ Customer Invoices ‣ Advanced Settings ‣ Electronic Invoicing, and tick E-FFF
(BE) and Peppol BIS Billing 3.0.

[Electronic invoicing
(EDI)](../accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing.html)

## Cash discount

In Belgium, if an early payment discount is offered on an invoice, the tax is
calculated based on the discounted total amount, whether the customer benefits
from the discount or not.

To apply the right tax amount and report it correctly in your VAT return, set
the tax reduction as Always (upon invoice).

reduction](../accounting/customer_invoices/cash_discounts.html)

## Fiscal certification: POS restaurant

In Belgium, the owner of a cooking business such as a restaurant or food truck
is required by law to use a government-certified **Cash Register System** for
their receipts. This applies if their yearly earnings (excluding VAT, drinks,
and take-away food) exceed 25,000 euros.

This government-certified system entails the use of a certified POS system,
along with a device called a Fiscal Data Module (or **black box**) and a VAT
Signing Card.

Important

Do not forget to register as _foodservice industry manager_ on the [Federal
Public Service Finance registration
form](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/enregistrement).

### Certified POS system

The Odoo POS system is certified for the major versions of databases hosted on
**Odoo Online** and **Odoo.sh**. Please refer to the following table to ensure
that your POS system is certified.

| Odoo Online | Odoo.sh | On-Premise  
---|---|---|---  
Odoo 16.0 | Certified | Certified | Not certified  
Odoo 15.2 | Not certified | Not certified | Not certified  
Odoo 15.0 | Certified | Certified | Not certified  
Odoo 14.0 | Certified | Certified | Not certified

[Supported versions](../../../administration/supported_versions.html)

A [certified POS system](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/systemes-
certifies) must adhere to rigorous government regulations, which means it
operates differently from a non-certified POS.

  * On a certified POS, you cannot:

    * Set up and use the **global discounts** feature (the `pos_discount` module is blacklisted and cannot be activated).

    * Set up and use the **loyalty programs** feature (the `pos_loyalty` module is blacklisted and cannot be activated).

    * Reprint receipts (the `pos_reprint` module is blacklisted and cannot be activated).

    * Modify prices in order lines.

    * Modify or delete order lines in POS orders.

    * Sell products without a valid VAT number.

    * Use a POS that is not connected to an IoT box.

  * The [cash rounding](../../sales/point_of_sale/pricing/cash_rounding.html) feature must be activated and set to a Rounding Precision of `0,05` and a Rounding Method set as Half-Up.

  * Taxes must be set as included in the price. To set it up, go to Point of Sale ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, and from the Accounting section, open the Default Sales Tax form by clicking the arrow next to the default sales tax field. There, click Advanced Options and enable Included in Price.

  * At the start of a POS session, users must click Work in to clock in. Doing so allows the registration of POS orders. If users are not clocked in, they cannot make POS orders. Likewise, they must click Work Out to clock out at the end of the session.

Warning

If you configure a POS to work with a FDM, you cannot use it again without it.

### Fiscal Data Module (FDM)

An FDM, or **black box** , is a government-certified device that works
together with the Point of Sale application and saves your POS orders
information. Concretely, a **hash** (unique code) is generated for each POS
order and added to its receipt. This allows the government to verify that all
revenue is declared.

Warning

Only the FDM from **Boîtenoire.be** with the [FDM certificate number
BMC04](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/systemes-
certifies#FDM%20certifiés) is supported by Odoo. [Contact the manufacturer
(GCV BMC)](https://www.boîtenoire.be/contact) to order one.

#### Configuration

Before setting up your database to work with an FDM, ensure you have the
following hardware:

  * a **Boîtenoire.be** (certificate number BMC04) FDM;

  * an RS-232 serial null modem cable per FDM;

  * an RS-232 serial-to-USB adapter per FDM;

  * an IoT Box (one IoT box per FDM); and

  * a receipt printer.

##### Black box module

As a pre-requisite, [activate](../../general/apps_modules.html#general-
install) the `Belgian Registered Cash Register` module (technical name:
`pos_blackbox_be`).

![black box modules for belgian fiscal certification](../../../_images/be-
modules.png)

Once the module is activated, add your VAT number to your company information.
To set it up, go to Settings ‣ Companies ‣ Update Info, and fill in the VAT
field. Then, enter a national registration number for every staff member who
operates the POS system. To do so, go to the Employees app and open an
employee form. There, go to HR settings tab ‣ Attendance/Point of Sale, and
fill in the INSZ or BIS number field.

![ISNZ or BIS number field on employee form](../../../_images/bis-number.png)

Tip

To input your information, click on your avatar, go to My Profile ‣ Preference
tab, and enter your INSZ or BIS number in the designated field.

Warning

You must configure the FDM directly in the production database. Utilizing it
in a testing environment may result in incorrect data being stored within the
FDM.

##### IoT Box

In order to use an FDM, you need a registered IoT Box. To register your IoT
box, you must contact us through our [support contact
form](https://www.odoo.com/help) and provide the following information:

  * your VAT number;

  * your company’s name, address, and legal structure; and

  * the Mac address of your IoT Box.

Once your IoT box is certified,
[connect](../../general/iot/config/connect.html) it to your database. To
verify that the IoT Box recognizes the FDM, go to the IoT homepage and scroll
down the IOT Device section, which should display the FDM.

![Hardware status page on a registered IoT Box](../../../_images/iot-
devices.png)

Then, add the IoT to your POS. To do so, go to Point of Sale ‣ Configuration ‣
Point of Sale, select your POS, scroll down to the Connected Device section,
and enable IoT Box. Lastly, add the FMD in the Fiscal Data Module field.

Note

To be able to use an FDM, you must at least connect one Receipt Printer.

### VAT signing card

When you open a POS session and make your initial transaction, you are
prompted to enter the PIN provided with your VSC. The card is delivered by the
FPS upon
[registration](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/enregistrement).
