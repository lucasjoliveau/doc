existing contact form.

  * **Name**

  * **Email**

  * **Identification Number**

  * **Taxpayer Type**

  * **Activity Description**

In the **Electronic Invoicing** tab:

  * **DTE Email** : enter the sender’s email address for the partner.

the contact that will be part of an electronic document.</p>
</div> ![Chilean electronic invoice data for
partners.](../../../_images/dte-email-electronic-invoice.png)

## Document types

Accounting documents are categorized by SII-defined document types.

Document types are created automatically upon installation of the localization
module, and can be managed by navigating to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣
Document Types.

![Chilean fiscal document types list.](../../../_images/chilean-document-
types.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Several document types are inactive by default but can be activated by toggling the
<b>Active</b> option.</p>
</div>

### Use on invoices

The document type on each transaction is determined by:

  * The journal related to the invoice, identifying if the journal uses documents.

  * The condition applied based on the type of issuer and recipient (e.g., the buyer or vendor’s fiscal regime).

## Journals

_Sales journals_ in Konvergo ERP usually represent a business unit or location.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><ul>
<li><p>Ventas Santiago.</p></li>
<li><p>Ventas Valparaiso.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

For retail stores it is common to have one journal per POS.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><ul>
<li><p>Cashier 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Cashier 2.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

The _purchase_ transactions can be managed with a single journal, but
sometimes companies use more than one journal in order to handle some
accounting transactions that are not related to vendor bills. This
configuration can easily be set by using the following model.

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<p class="alert-title">

</ul>
</div>0

### Create a sales journal

To create a sales journal, navigate to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Journals.
Then, click the **New** button, and fill in the following required
information:

  * **Type** : select **Sale** from the drop-down menu for customer invoice journals.

  * **Point of sale type** : if the sales journal will be used for electronic documents, the option **Online** must be selected. Otherwise, if the journal is used for invoices imported from a previous system or if you are using the SII portal _Facturación MiPyme_ , you can use the option **Manual**.

  * **Use Documents** : check this field if the journal will use document types. This field is only applicable to purchase and sales journals that can be related to the different sets of document types available in Chile. By default, all the sales journals created will use documents.

Next, from the **Jounal Entries** tab, define the **Default Income Account**
and **Dedicated Credit Note Squence** in the **Accounting Information**
section. Configuring these fields is required for one of the debit notes use
cases.

## CAF

A _folio authorization code_ (CAF) is required for each document type that
will be issued electronically. The CAF is a file the SII provides to the
issuer with the folios/sequences authorized for the electronic invoice
documents.

Your company can request multiple folios and obtain several CAFs linked to
different folio ranges. These CAFs are shared within all journals, so you only
need one active CAF per document type, and it will be applied to all journals.

Please refer to the [SII
documentation](https://palena.sii.cl/dte/mn_timbraje) to check the
details on how to acquire the CAF files.

</ul>
</div>1

### Upload CAF files

Once the CAF files have been acquired from the SII portal, they need to be
uploaded in the database by navigating to Accounting ‣ Configuration: Chilean
SII ‣ CAFs. Then, click the **New** begin the configuration. On the CAF form,
upload your CAF file by clicking the **Upload your file** button and then
click **Save**.

Once uploaded, the status changes to **In Use**. At this moment, when a
transaction is used for this document type, the invoice number takes the first
folio in the sequence.

</ul>
</div>2

## Chart of accounts

The chart of accounts is installed by default as part of the data set included
in the localization module. The accounts are mapped automatically in:

  * Taxes

  * Default Account Payable

  * Default Account Receivable

  * Transfer Accounts

  * Conversion Rate

</ul>
</div>3

## Taxes

As part of the localization module, taxes are created automatically with their
related financial account and configuration. These taxes can be managed from
Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Taxes.

Chile has several tax types, the most common ones are:

  * **VAT** : the regular VAT can have several rates.

  * **ILA** : the tax for alcoholic drinks.

## Usage and testing

### Electronic invoice workflow

In the Chilean localization, the electronic invoice workflow includes customer
invoice issuance and vendor bill reception. The following diagram explains how
information is shared to the SII, customers, and vendors.

![Diagram with Electronic invoice transactions.](../../../_images/electronic-
invoice-workflow.png)

### Customer invoice emission

After the partners and journals are created and configured, the invoices are
created in the standard way. For Chile, one of the differences is the document
type that is automatically selected based on the taxpayer. The document type
can be changed manually if needed on the invoice by navigating to Accounting ‣
Customers ‣ Invoices.

![Customer invoice document type selection.](../../../_images/customer-
invoice-document-type.png) <div class="alert alert-secondary">

</ul>
</div>5

#### Validation and DTE status

Once all invoice information is filled, either manually or automatically when
generated from a sales order, validate the invoice. After the invoice is
posted:

  * The DTE file is created automatically and recorded in the chatter.

  * The DTE SII status is set as **Pending** to be sent.

![DTE XML File displayed in chatter.](../../../_images/xml-creation.png)

The DTE status is updated automatically by Konvergo ERP with a scheduled action that
runs every day at night, if the response from the SII is needed immediately,
you can do it manually as well by following the DTE status workflow:

![Transition of DTE status flow.](../../../_images/dte-status-flow.png)

  1. The first step is to send the DTE to the SII. This can be sent manually by clicking the **Enviar Ahora** button. This generates a **SII Tack number** for the invoice, which is used to check the details sent by the SII via email. Then, the **DTE status** is updated to **Ask for Status**.

  2. Once the SII response is received, Konvergo ERP updates the **DTE status**. To do it manually, click on the button **Verify on SII**. The result can either be **Accepted** , **Accepted With Objection** or **Rejected**.

![Identification transaction for invoice and Status
update.](../../../_images/dte-status-steps.png) <div class="alert alert-secondary">
<p class="alert-title">
See also</p><ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qYkgbmBYHw">Chilean localization app tour</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.odoo.com/slides/smart-tutorial-localizacion-de-chile-131">Chilean localization smart tutorial</a></p></li>
</ul>
</div>6

  3. The final response from the SII can take on one of these values:

     * **Accepted** : indicates the invoice information is correct, our document is now fiscally valid and it’s automatically sent to the customer.

     * **Accepted with objections** : indicates the invoice information is correct, but a minor issue was identified, nevertheless the document is now fiscally valid and it’s automatically sent to the customer.

     * **Rejected** : indicates the invoice information is incorrect and must be corrected. Details are sent to emails you registered in the SII. If it is properly configured in Konvergo ERP, the details are also retrieved in the chatter once the email server is processed.

If the invoice is rejected please follow these steps:

       1. Change the document to **Draft**.

       2. Make the required corrections based on the message received from the SII in the chatter.

       3. Post the invoice again.

![Message when an invoice is rejected.](../../../_images/rejected-invoice.png)

#### Crossed references

When the invoice is created, as a result of another fiscal document, the
information related to the originator document must be registered in the
**Cross-Reference** tab. This tab is commonly used for credit or debit notes,
however, in some cases it can be used for customer invoices, as well. In the
case of the credit and debit notes, they are set automatically by Konvergo ERP.

![Crossed referenced document\(s\).](../../../_images/cross-reference-tab-
registration.png)

#### Invoice PDF report

Once the invoice is accepted and validated by the SII and the PDF is printed,
it includes the fiscal elements that indicate that the document is fiscally
valid.

![SII Validation fiscal elements.](../../../_images/sii-validation-
elements.png) <div class="alert alert-secondary">

</ul>
</div>7

#### Commercial validation

Once the invoice has been sent to the customer:

  1. **DTE Partner Status** changes to **Sent**.

  2. The customer must send a reception confirmation email.

  3. Subsequently, if commercial terms and invoice data are correct, an acceptance confirmation is sent; otherwise, a claim is sent.

  4. The field **DTE Acceptance Status** is updated automatically.

![Message with the commercial acceptance from the
customer.](../../../_images/partner-dte-status.png)

#### Processed for claimed invoices

Once the invoice has been accepted by the SII, **it can not be cancelled in
Konvergo ERP**. In case you get a claim for your customer, the correct way to proceed
is with a credit note to either cancel the invoice or correct it. Please refer
to the Credit notes section for more details.

![Invoice Commercial status updated to claimed.](../../../_images/accepted-
invoice.png)

#### Common errors

There are multiple reasons behind a rejection from the SII, but these are some
of the common errors you might have and how to solve them:

  * **Error:** `RECHAZO- DTE Sin Comuna Origen`

**Hint:** make sure the company address is properly filled including the state
and city.

  * **Error:** `en Monto - IVA debe declararse`

**Hint:** the invoice lines should include one VAT tax, make sure you add one
on each invoice line.

  * **Error:** `Rut No Autorizado a Firmar`

**Hint:** the RUT entered is not allowed to invoice electronically, make sure
the company RUT is correct and is valid in the SII to invoice electronically.

  * **Error:** `Fecha/Número Resolucion Invalido RECHAZO- CAF Vencido : (Firma_DTE[AAAA-MM-DD] - CAF[AAAA-MM-DD]) &gt; 6 meses`

**Hint:** try to add a new CAF related to this document as the one you’re
using is expired.

  * **Error:** `Element '{http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutReceptor': This element is not expected. Expected is ( {http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutEnvia ).`

**Hint:** Make sure the field **Document Type** and **VAT** are set in the
customer and in the main company.

  * **Error:** `Usuario sin permiso de envio.`

**Hint:** this error indicates that most likely, your company has not passed
the [Certification
process](https://www.sii.cl/factura_electronica/factura_mercado/proceso_certificacion.htm)
in the SII \- Sistema de Facturación de Mercado. If this is the case, please
contact your Account Manager or Customer Support as this certification is not
part of the Konvergo ERP services, but we can give you some alternatives. If you
already passed the certification process, this error appears when a user
different from the owner of the certificate is trying to send DTE files to the
SII.

  * **Error:** `CARATULA`

**Hint:** there are just five reasons why this error could show up and all of
them are related to the _Caratula_ section of the XML:

>     * The company’s RUT number is incorrect or missing.
>
>     * The certificate owner RUT number is incorrect or missing.
>
>     * The SII’s RUT number (this should be correct by default) is incorrect
> or missing.
>
>     * The resolution date is incorrect or missing.
>
>     * The resolution number is incorrect or missing.

### Credit notes

When a cancellation or correction is needed over a validated invoice, a credit
note must be generated. It is important to consider that a CAF file is
required for the credit note, which is identified as **Document Type** **61**
in the SII. Please refer to the CAF section for more information on the
process to load the CAF on each document type.

![Creation of CAF for Credit notes.](../../../_images/credit-note-document-
type.png)

#### Use cases

##### Cancel referenced document

In case you need to cancel or invalidate an invoice, navigate to Accounting ‣
Customers ‣ Invoices and select the desired invoice. Then, use the button
**Add Credit Note** and select **Full Refund** , in this case the SII
reference code is automatically set to **Anula Documento de referencia**.

![Credit note canceling the referenced document.](../../../_images/credit-
note-cancel-ref-doc.png)

##### Correct referenced document

If a correction in the invoice information is required, for example the street
name on the original invoice is wrong, then use the button **Add Credit Note**
, select **Partial Refund** and select the option **Only Text Correction**. In
this case the **SII Reference Code** field is automatically set to **Corrects
Referenced Document Text**.

![Credit note correcting referenced document text.](../../../_images/credit-
note-correct-text.png)

Konvergo ERP creates a credit note with the corrected text in an invoice and **Price**
`0.00`.

![Credit note with the corrected value on the invoice
lines.](../../../_images/text-correction-label.png) <div class="alert alert-secondary">

</ul>
</div>8

##### Corrects referenced document amount

When a correction on the amounts is required, use the button **Add Credit
note** and select **Partial Refund**. In this case the **SII Reference Code**
is automatically set to **Corrige el monto del Documento de Referencia**.

![Credit note for partial refund to correct amounts, using the SII reference
code 3.](../../../_images/credit-note-correct-amount.png)

### Debit notes

In Chilean localization, debit notes, in addition to credit notes, can be
created using the **Add Debit Note** button, with two main use cases.

#### Use cases

##### Add debt on invoices

The primary use case for debit notes is to increase the value of an existing
invoice. To do so, select option **3\. Corrige el monto del Documento de
Referencia** for the **Reference Code SII** field.

![Debit note correcting referenced document amount.](../../../_images/debit-
note-correct-amount.png)

In this case Konvergo ERP automatically includes the **Source Invoice** in the **Cross
Reference** tab.

</ul>
</div>9

##### Cancel credit notes

In Chile, debits notes are used to cancel a valid credit note. To do this,
click the **Add Debit Note** button and select the **1: Anula Documentos de
referencia** option for the **Reference Code SII** field.

![Debit note to cancel the referenced document \(credit
note\).](../../../_images/debit-note-cancel-ref-doc.png)

### Vendor bills

As part of the Chilean localization, you can configure your incoming email
server to match the one you have registered in the SII in order to:

  * Automatically receive the vendor bills DTE and create the vendor bill based on this information.

  * Automatically send the reception acknowledgement to your vendor.

  * Accept or claim the document and send this status to your vendor.

#### Reception

As soon as the vendor email with the attached DTE is received:

  1. The vendor bill maps all the information included in the XML.

  2. An email is sent to the vendor with the reception acknowledgement.

  3. The **DTE Status** is set as **Acuse de Recibido Enviado**.

#### Acceptation

If all the commercial information is correct on your vendor bill, then you can
accept the document using the **Aceptar Documento** button. Once this is done,
the **DTE Acceptation Status** changes to **Accepted** and an email of
acceptance is sent to the vendor.

![Button for accepting vendor bills.](../../../_images/accept-vendor-bill-
btn.png)

#### Claim

In case there is a commercial issue or the information is not correct on your
vendor bill, you can claim the document before validating it, using the
**Claim** button. Once this is done, the **DTE Acceptation Status** changes to
**Claim** and a rejection email is sent to the vendor.

![Claim button in vendor bills to inform the vendor all the document is
commercially rejected.](../../../_images/claim-vendor-bill-btn.png)

If you claim a vendor bill, the status changes from **Draft** to **Cancel**
automatically. Considering this as best practice, all the claimed documents
should be canceled as they won’t be valid for your accounting records.

### Electronic purchase invoice

The _electronic purchase invoice_ is a feature included in the `l10n_cl_edi`
module.

Once all configurations have been made for electronic invoices (e.g.,
uploading a valid company certificate, setting up master data, etc.), the
electronic purchase invoices need their own CAFs. Please refer to the CAF
documentation to check the details on how to acquire the CAFs for electronic
purchase invoices.

Electronic purchase invoices are useful when vendors are not obligated to
expedite an electronic vendor bill for your purchase. Still, your obligations
require a document to be sent to the SII as proof of purchase.

#### Configuration

To generate an electronic purchase invoice from a vendor bill, the bill must
be created in a purchase journal with the _Use Documents_ feature enabled. It
is possible to modify an existing purchase journal or create a new one in the
following process.

To modify the existing purchase journal, or create a new purchase journal,
navigate to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Journals. Then, click the **New**
button, and fill in the following required information:

  * **Type** : select **Purchase** from the drop-down menu for vendor bill journals.

  * **Use Documents** : check this field so the journal can generate electronic documents (in this case the electronic purchase invoice).

#### Generate an electronic purchase invoice

To generate this type of document, it is necessary to create a vendor bill in
Konvergo ERP. To do so, navigate to Accounting ‣ Vendors ‣ Bills, and click the
**New** button.

When all of the electronic purchase invoice information is filled, select the
option **(46) Electronic Purchase Invoice** in the **Document Type** field:

After the vendor bill is posted:

  * The DTE file (Electronic Tax Document) is automatically created and added to the chatter.

  * The **DTE SII Status** is set as **Pending to be sent**.

Konvergo ERP automatically updates the _DTE Status_ every night using a scheduled
action. To get a response from the SII immediately, click the **Send now to
SII** button.

### Delivery guide

To install the **Delivery Guide** module, go to Apps and search for `Chile
(l10n_cl)`. Then click **Install** on the module **Chile - E-Invoicing
Delivery Guide**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><ul>
<li><p>Konvergo ERP automatically installs the appropriate package for the company according to the country
selected at the creation of the database.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Chile - E-Invoicing Delivery Guide</em> module depends on the <em>Inventory</em> application.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>0

The _Delivery Guide_ module includes the ability to send the DTE to SII and
the stamp in PDF reports for deliveries.

Once all configurations have been made for electronic invoices (e.g.,
uploading a valid company certificate, setting up master data, etc.), delivery
guides need their own CAFs. Please refer to the CAF documentation to check the
details on how to acquire the CAF for electronic Delivery Guides.

Verify the following important information in the **Price for the Delivery
Guide** configuration:

  * **From Sales Order** : delivery guide takes the product price from the sales order and shows it on the document.

  * **From Product Template** : Konvergo ERP takes the price configured in the product template and shows it on the document.

  * **No show price** : no price is shown in the delivery guide.

Electronic delivery guides are used to move stock from one place to another
and they can represent sales, sampling, consignment, internal transfers, and
basically any product move.

#### Delivery guide from a sales process

<div class="alert alert-primary">

</ul>
</div>1

When a sales order is created and confirmed, a delivery order is generated.
After validating the delivery order, the option to create a delivery guide is
activated.

![Create Delivery Guide button on a sales process.](../../../_images/delivery-
guide-creation-btn.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">

</ul>
</div>2

This warning message means the user needs to indicate the next sequence number
Konvergo ERP has to take to generate the delivery guide (e.g. next available CAF
number), and only happens the first time a delivery guide is created in Konvergo ERP.
After the first document has been correctly generated, Konvergo ERP takes the next
available number in the CAF file to generate the following delivery guide.

After the delivery guide is created:

  * The DTE file (Electronic Tax Document) is automatically created and added to the **chatter**.

  * The **DTE SII Status** is set as **Pending to be sent**.

![Chatter notes of Delivery Guide creation.](../../../_images/chatter-
delivery-guide.png)

The **DTE Status** is automatically updated by Konvergo ERP with a scheduled action
that runs every night. To get a response from the SII immediately, press the
**Send now to SII** button.

Once the delivery guide is sent, it may then be printed by clicking on the
**Print Delivery Guide** button.

![Printing Delivery Guide PDF.](../../../_images/print-delivery-guide-btn.png)

Delivery guide will have fiscal elements that indicate that the document is
fiscally valid when printed (if hosted in _Konvergo ERP SH_ or on _On-premise_
remember to manually add the **pdf417gen** library mentioned in the Invoice
PDF report section).

### Electronic receipt

To install the **Electronic Receipt** module, go to Apps and search for `Chile
(l10n_cl)`. Then click **Install** on the module **Chile - Electronic
Receipt**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><ul>
<li><p>Konvergo ERP automatically installs the appropriate package for the company according to the country

</ul>
</div>3

Once all configurations have been made for electronic invoices (e.g.,
uploading a valid company certificate, setting up master data, etc.),
electronic receipts need their own CAFs. Please refer to the CAF documentation
to check the details on how to acquire the CAFs for electronic receipts.

Electronic receipts are useful when clients do not need an electronic invoice.
By default, there is a partner in the database called **Anonymous Final
Consumer** with a generic RUT `66666666-6` and taxpayer type of **Final
Consumer**. This partner can be used for electronic receipts or a new record
may be created for the same purpose.

![Electronic Receipt module.](../../../_images/electronic-receipt-
customer.png)

Although electronic receipts should be used for final consumers with a generic
RUT, it can also be used for specific partners. After the partners and
journals are created and configured, the electronic receipts are created in
the standard way as electronic invoice, but the type of document **(39)
Electronic Receipt** should be selected in the invoice form:

![Document type 39 for Electronic Receipts.](../../../_images/document-
type-39.png)

#### Validation and DTE status

When all of the electronic receipt information is filled, manually (or
automatically) proceed to validate the receipt from the sales order. By
default, **Electronic Invoice** is selected as the **Document Type** , however
in order to validate the receipt correctly, make sure to edit the **Document
Type** and change to **Electronic Receipt**.

After the receipt is posted:

  * The DTE file (Electronic Tax Document) is created automatically and added to the **chatter**.

  * The **DTE SII Status** is set as **Pending to be sent**.

![Electronic Receipts STE creation status.](../../../_images/electronic-
receipt-ste-status.png)

The **DTE Status** is automatically updated by Konvergo ERP with a scheduled action
that runs every day at night. To get a response from the SII immediately,
press the **Send now to SII** button.

Please refer to the DTE Workflow for electronic invoices as the workflow for
electronic receipt follows the same process.

### Electronic export of goods

To install the **Electronic Exports of Goods** module, go to Apps and search
for `Chile (l10n_cl)`. Then click **Install** on the module **Electronic
Exports of Goods for Chile**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">

</ul>
</div>4

Once all configurations have been made for electronic invoices (e.g.,
uploading a valid company certificate, setting up master data, etc.),
electronic exports of goods need their own CAFs. Please refer to the CAF
documentation to check the details on how to acquire the CAFs for electronic
receipts.

Electronic invoices for the export of goods are tax documents that are used
not only for the SII but are also used with customs and contain the
information required by it.

#### Contact configurations

#### PDF report

Once the invoice is accepted and validated by the SII and the PDF is printed,
it includes the fiscal elements that indicate that the document is fiscally
valid and a new section needed for customs.
