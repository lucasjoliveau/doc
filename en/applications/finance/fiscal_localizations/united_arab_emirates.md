You can Enable/Disable reconciliation or **configure** specific accounts
according to your needs.

Important

  * Always keep at least one **receivable account** and one **payable account** active.

  * It is also advised to **keep the accounts below active** , as they are used either as transitory accounts by Odoo or are specific to the **UAE localization package**.

## Taxes

To access your taxes, go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Taxes.
Activate/deactivate, or [configure](../accounting/taxes.html) the taxes
relevant to your business by clicking on them. Remember to only set tax
accounts on the **5%** tax group, as other groups do not need closing. To do
so, enable the [developer mode](../../general/developer_mode.html) and go to
Configuration â€£ Tax Groups. Then, set a Tax current account (payable), Tax
current account (receivable), and an Advance Tax payment account for the
**5%** group.

Note

The RCM is supported by Odoo.

## Currency exchange rates

To update the currency exchange rates, go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£
Settings â€£ Currencies. Click on the update button (ðŸ—˜) found next to the Next
Run field.

By default, the UAE Central Bank exchange rates web service is used. Several
other providers are available under the Service field.

## Payroll

The UAE - Payroll module creates the necessary **salary rules** in the Payroll
app in compliance with the UAE rules and regulations. The salary rules are
linked to the corresponding accounts in the **chart of accounts**.

salary-rules.png)

### Salary rules

To apply these rules to an employeeâ€™s contract, go to Payroll â€£ Contracts â€£
Contracts and select the employeeâ€™s contract. In the Salary Structure Type
field, select UAE Employee.

![Select the Salary Structure Type to apply to the
contract.](../../../_images/uae-localization-salary-structure.png)

Under the Salary Information tab, you can find details such as the:

  * Wage;

  * Housing Allowance;

  * Transportation Allowance;

  * Other Allowances;

  * Number of Days: used to calculate the end of service provision.

Note

  * **Leave deductions** are calculated using a salary rule linked to the **unpaid leave** time-off type;

  * Any other deductions or reimbursements are made _manually_ using other inputs;

  * **Overtimes** are added _manually_ by going to Work Entries â€£ Work Entries;

  * **Salary attachments** are generated by going to Contracts â€£ Salary Attachments. Then, Create an attachment and select the Employee and the Type (Attachment of Salary, Assignment of Salary, Child Support).

Tip

To prevent a rule from appearing on a paycheck, go to Payroll â€£ Configuration
â€£ Rules. Click on UAE Employee Payroll Structure, select the rule to hide, and
uncheck Appears on Payslip.

### End of service provision

The provision is defined as the total monthly allowance _divided_ by 30 and
then _multiplied_ by the number of days set in the field Number of days at the
bottom of a contractâ€™s form.

The provision is then calculated via a salary rule associated with two
accounts: the **End Of Service Indemnity (Expense account)** and the **End of
Service Provision (Non-current Liabilities account)**. The latter is used to
pay off the **end of service amount** by settling it with the **payables
account**.

Note

The end of service amount is calculated based on the gross salary and the
start and end dates of the employeeâ€™s contract.

### Invoices

The UAE localization package allows the generation of invoices in English,
Arabic, or both. The localization also includes a line to display the **VAT
amount** per line.
