## Taxes

To access your taxes, go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Taxes.
Activate/deactivate, or [configure](../accounting/taxes) the taxes
relevant to your business by clicking on them. Remember to only set tax
accounts on the **5%** tax group, as other groups do not need closing. To do
so, enable the [developer mode](../../general/developer_mode) and go to
Configuration â€£ Tax Groups. Then, set a **Tax current account (payable)** ,
**Tax current account (receivable)** , and an **Advance Tax payment account**
for the **5%** group.

## Currency exchange rates

To update the currency exchange rates, go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£
Settings â€£ Currencies. Click on the update button (**ðŸ—˜**) found next to the
**Next Run** field.

To launch the update automatically at set intervals, change the **Interval**

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>By default, the UAE Central Bank exchange rates web service is used. Several other providers are
available under the <b>Service</b> field.</p>
</div>

## Payroll

The **UAE - Payroll** module creates the necessary **salary rules** in the
Payroll app in compliance with the UAE rules and regulations. The salary rules
are linked to the corresponding accounts in the **chart of accounts**.

![The UAE Employee Payroll Structure.](../../../_images/uae-localization-
salary-rules.png)

### Salary rules

To apply these rules to an employeeâ€™s contract, go to Payroll â€£ Contracts â€£
Contracts and select the employeeâ€™s contract. In the **Salary Structure Type**
field, select **UAE Employee**.

![Select the Salary Structure Type to apply to the
contract.](../../../_images/uae-localization-salary-structure.png)

Under the **Salary Information** tab, you can find details such as the:

  * **Wage** ;

  * **Housing Allowance** ;

  * **Transportation Allowance** ;

  * **Other Allowances** ;

  * **Number of Days** : used to calculate the end of service provision.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><ul>
<li><p><b>Leave deductions</b> are calculated using a salary rule linked to the <b>unpaid leave</b> time-off
type;</p></li>
<li><p>Any other deductions or reimbursements are made <em>manually</em> using other inputs;</p></li>
<li><p><b>Overtimes</b> are added <em>manually</em> by going to Work Entries â€£ Work Entries;</p></li>
<li><p><b>Salary attachments</b> are generated by going to Contracts â€£

</ul>
</div> <div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>To prevent a rule from appearing on a paycheck, go to Payroll â€£ Configuration
â€£ Rules. Click on <b>UAE Employee Payroll Structure</b>, select the rule to hide, and
uncheck <b>Appears on Payslip</b>.</p>
</div>

### End of service provision

The provision is defined as the total monthly allowance _divided_ by 30 and
then _multiplied_ by the number of days set in the field **Number of days** at
the bottom of a contractâ€™s form.

The provision is then calculated via a salary rule associated with two
accounts: the **End Of Service Indemnity (Expense account)** and the **End of
Service Provision (Non-current Liabilities account)**. The latter is used to
pay off the **end of service amount** by settling it with the **payables
account**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The end of service amount is calculated based on the gross salary and the start and end dates of
the employeeâ€™s contract.</p>
</div>

### Invoices

The UAE localization package allows the generation of invoices in English,
Arabic, or both. The localization also includes a line to display the **VAT
amount** per line.
