### Company information

Go to Settings ‣ General Settings ‣ Companies, click Update info, and ensure
the following company information is complete and up-to-date.

  * The full Company Name.

  * All relevant Address fields, including the Building Number and Plot Identification (four digits each).

  * Select an enterprise Identification Scheme. It is recommended to use the Commercial Registration Number.

  * Enter the Identification Number for the selected Identification Scheme.

  * The VAT number.

  * Ensure the Currency is set to SAR.

Note

It is also necessary to fill out similar information for partner companies.

### Simulation mode

Important

It is strongly recommended to thoroughly test all invoicing workflows using
the Fatoora **simulation** portal first, as **any** invoice submitted to the
regular Fatoora portal will be accounted for, which could lead to fines and
penalties.

#### Fatoora simulation portal

Log in on the [Fatoora portal](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/) using the
company’s ZATCA credentials. Then, click the Fatoora Simulation Portal button
to switch to the simulation portal.

#### ZATCA API integration

On Odoo, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings. Under ZATCA API
Integration, select the Simulation (Pre-Production) API mode and click Save.

#### Sales journals

Each sales journal on Odoo needs to be configured. To do so, go to Accounting
‣ Configuration ‣ Journals, open any sales journal (e.g., Customer Invoices),
and go to the ZATCA tab. Once there, enter any Serial Number to identify the
journal.

Note

The same serial number can be used for all of the company’s sales journals.

Next, click Onboard Journal. In the dialog box, providing an OTP code is
required. To retrieve it, open the [Fatoora simulation
portal](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/), click Onboard New Solution
Unit/Device, choose the number of OTP codes to generate (one per journal to
configure), and click Generate OTP Code. Copy an OTP code, it into the dialog
box on Odoo, and click Request.

Note

OTP codes expire after one hour.

Tip

If any issue occurs during onboarding, click Regenerate CSR to start again.

#### Testing

When confirming an invoice, there is now an option to process the invoice,
sending it directly the Fatoora simulation portal. Odoo displays the portal’s
response after each submission. Only rejected invoices can be reset to draft
and edited on Odoo. Furthermore, at the end of each day, Odoo sends all
unprocessed invoices to the portal.

Tip

  * Testing all invoicing workflows, preferably with real invoices and for a reasonable amount of time, is recommended.

  * Compare the invoices received statistics page on the Fatoora simulation portal with the list of invoices on Odoo to ensure both align.

#### Taxes

When using a **0% tax** in a customer invoice, it is necessary to specify the
reason behind such a rate. To configure taxes, go to Accounting ‣
Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Taxes, and open the tax to edit. Under the Advanced
Options, select an Exemption Reason Code and click Save.

When using **retention** or **withholding an amount** in a customer invoice,
the tax used to retain the amount needs to be specified.

### Production mode

When ready for production, change the API mode to Production and click Save.

Warning

Setting the API mode to Production is **irreversible**.

The sales journals initially linked to the simulation portal now needs to be
linked to the regular portal. To do so, onboard the journals again, ensuring
to use the regular [Fatoora portal](https://fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/) this time.
