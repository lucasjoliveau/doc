# Expenses

Konvergo ERP **Expenses** streamlines the management of expenses. After an employee
submits their expenses in Konvergo ERP, the expenses are reviewed by management and
accounting teams. Once approved, payments can then be processed and disbursed
back to the employee for reimbursement(s).

## Set expense categories

The first step to track expenses is to configure the different types of
expenses for the company (managed as _expense categories_ in Konvergo ERP). Each
category can be as specific or generalized as needed. Go to Expenses app ‚Ä£
Configuration ‚Ä£ Expense Categories to view the current expensable categories
in a default list view.

![Set expense costs on products.](../../_images/categories.png)

To create a new expense category, click **New**. A product form will appear,
with the description field labeled **Product Name**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Expense categories are managed like products in Konvergo ERP. The expense category form follows the
standard product form in Konvergo ERP, and the information entered is similar. Expense products will be
referred to as expense categories throughout this document since the main menu refers to these as
<b>Expense Categories</b>.</p>
</div>

Only two fields are required, the **Product Name** and the **Unit of
Measure**. Enter the **Product Name** in the field, and select the **Unit of
Measure** from the drop-down menu (most products will be set to **Units**).

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>The <em>Sales</em> app is where specification on the units of measure are created and edited (e.g.
units, miles, nights, etc.). Go to Sales app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings and
ensure <code>Units of Measure</code> is enabled in the <code>Product Catalog</code> section. Click on the
<b>Units of Measure</b> internal link to <a href="../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/product_replenishment/uom">view, create, and edit the units of measure</a>.</p>
</div> ![Set expense costs on products.](../../_images/new-
expense-product.png)

The **Cost** field on the product form is populated with a value of `0.00` by
default. When a specific expense should always be reimbursed for a particular
price, enter that amount in the **Cost** field. Otherwise, leave the **Cost**
set to `0.00`, and employees will report the actual cost when submitting an
expense report.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <b>Cost</b> field is always visible on the expense category form, but the
<b>Sales Price</b> field is <em>only</em> visible if the <b>Sales Price</b> is selected under
the <b>Re-Invoice Expenses</b> section. Otherwise, the <b>Sales Price</b> field is
hidden.</p>
</div> <div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>Here are some examples for when to set a specific <b>Cost</b> on a product vs. leaving the
<b>Cost</b> at <code>0.00</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Meals</b>: Set the <b>Cost</b> to <code>0.00</code>. When an employee logs an expense for a meal,
they enter the actual amount of the bill and will be reimbursed for that amount. An expense for
a meal costing $95.23 would equal a reimbursement for $95.23.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Mileage</b>: Set the <b>Cost</b> to <code>0.30</code>. When an employee logs an expense for
‚Äúmileage‚Äù, they enter the number of miles driven in the <b>Quantity</b> field, and are
reimbursed 0.30 per mile they entered. An expense for 100 miles would equal a reimbursement for
$30.00.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Monthly Parking</b>: Set the <b>Cost</b> to <code>75.00</code>. When an employee logs an expense for
‚Äúmonthly parking‚Äù, the reimbursement would be for $75.00.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Expenses</b>: Set the <b>Cost</b> to <code>0.00</code>. When an employee logs an expense that is not
a meal, mileage, or monthly parking, they use the generic <b>Expenses</b> product. An
expense for a laptop costing $350.00 would be logged as an <b>Expenses</b> product, and
the reimbursement would be for $350.00.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

Select an **Expense Account** if using the Konvergo ERP _Accounting_ app. It is
recommended to check with the accounting department to determine the correct
account to reference in this field as it will affect reports.

Set a tax on each product in the **Vendor Taxes** and **Customer Taxes**
fields, if applicable. It is considered good practice to use a tax that is
configured with [Tax Included in Price](accounting/taxes#taxes-included-
in-price). Taxes will be automatically configured if this is set.

## Record expenses

### Manually create a new expense

To record a new expense, begin in the main Expenses app dashboard, which
presents the default **My Expenses** view. This view can also be accessed from
Expenses app ‚Ä£ My Expenses ‚Ä£ My Expenses.

First, click **New** , and then fill out the various fields on the form.

  * **Description** : Enter a short description for the expense in the **Description** field. This should be short and informative, such as `lunch with client` or `hotel for conference`.

  * **Category** : Select the expense category from the drop-down menu that most closely corresponds to the expense. For example, an airplane ticket would be appropriate for an expense **Category** named **Air Travel**.

  * **Total** : Enter the total amount paid for the expense in one of two ways:

    1. If the expense is for one single item/expense, and the category selected was for a single item, enter the cost in the **Total** field (the **Quantity** field is hidden).

    2. If the expense is for multiples of the same item/expense with a fixed price, the **Unit Price** is displayed. Enter the quantity in the **Quantity** field, and the total cost is automatically updated with the correct total (the **Unit Price** x the **Quantity** = the total). Be advised, the word ‚Äútotal‚Äù does not appear, the total cost simply appears below the **Quantity**.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>For example, in the case of mileage driven, the <b>Unit Price</b> is populated as the
cost <em>per mile</em>. Set the <b>Quantity</b> to the <em>number of miles</em> driven, and the total
is calculated.</p>
</div>

  * **Included Taxes** : If taxes were configured on the expense category, the tax percentage and amount appear automatically after entering either the **Total** or the **Quantity**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>When a tax is configured on an expense category, the <b>Included Taxes</b> value will
update in real time as the <b>Total</b> or <b>Quantity</b> is updated.</p>
</div>

  * **Employee** : Using the drop-down menu, select the employee this expense is for.

  * **Paid By** : Click the radio button to indicate who paid for the expense and should be reimbursed. If the employee paid for the expense (and should be reimbursed) select **Employee (to reimburse)**. If the company paid directly instead (e.g. if the company credit card was used to pay for the expense) select **Company**. Depending on the expense category selected, this field may not appear.

  * **Bill Reference** : If there is any reference text that should be included for the expense, enter it in this field.

  * **Expense Date** : Using the calendar module, enter the date the expense was incurred. Use the **< (left)** and **> (right)** arrows to navigate to the correct month, then click on the specific day to enter the selection.

  * **Account** : Select the expense account that this expense should be logged on from the drop-down menu.

  * **Customer to Reinvoice** : If the expense is something that should be paid for by a customer, select the SO and customer that will be invoiced for this expense from the drop-down menu. All sales orders in the drop-down menu list both the SO as well as the company the sales order is written for, but after the expense is saved, the customer name disappears and only the SO is visible on the expense.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>A customer wishes to have an on-site meeting for a custom garden (design and installation) and
agrees to pay for the expenses associated with it (such as travel, hotel, meals, etc.). All
expenses tied to that meeting would indicate the sales order for the custom garden (which also
references the customer) as the <b>Customer to Reinvoice</b>.</p>
</div>

  * **Analytic Distribution** : Select the account(s) the expense should be written against from the drop-down menu for either **Projects** , **Departments** , or both. Multiple accounts can be listed for each category if needed. Adjust the percentage for each analytic account by typing in the percentage value next to the account.

  * **Company** : If multiple companies are set up, select the company this expense should be filed for from the drop-down menu. The current company will automatically populate this field.

  * **Notes‚Ä¶** : If any notes are needed in order to clarify the expense, enter them in the notes field.

in.png)

#### Attach a receipt

After the expense is created, the next step is to attach a receipt. Click the
**Attach Receipt** button, and a file explorer appears. Navigate to the
receipt to be attached, and click **Open**. The new receipt is recorded in the
chatter, and the number of receipts will appear next to the **üìé (paperclip)**
icon beneath the expense form. More than one receipt can be attached to an
individual expense, as needed. The number of receipts attached to the expense
will be noted on the paperclip icon.

![Attach a receipt and it appears in the chatter.](../../_images/receipt-
icon.png)

### Create new expenses from a scanned receipt

Rather than manually inputting all of the information for an expense, expenses
can be created by scanning a PDF receipt.

First, in the main **Expenses** app dashboard view (this view can also be
accessed from Expenses app ‚Ä£ My Expenses ‚Ä£ My Expenses), click **Scan** , and
a file explorer pops up. Navigate to the receipt to be uploaded, click on it
to select it, and then click **Open**.

![Create an expense by scanning a receipt. Click Scan at the top of the
Expenses dashboard view.](../../_images/scan.png)

The receipt is scanned, and a new entry is created with today‚Äôs date as the
**Expense Date** , and any other fields it can populate based on the scanned
data, such as the total. Click on the new entry to open the individual expense
form, and make any changes needed. The scanned receipt appears in the chatter.

### Automatically create new expenses from an email

Instead of individually creating each expense in the _Expenses_ app, expenses
can be automatically created by sending an email to an email alias.

To do so, first, an email alias needs to be configured. Go to Expenses app ‚Ä£
Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings. Ensure **Incoming Emails** is enabled.

![Create the domain alias by clicking the link.](../../_images/email-
alias.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>If the domain alias needs to be set up, <b>Setup your domain alias</b> will appear beneath
the incoming emails check box instead of the email address field. Refer to this documentation for
setup instructions and more information:
<a href="../websites/website/configuration/domain_names">Domain names</a>. Once the domain alias is
configured, the email address field will be visible beneath the incoming emails section.</p>
</div>

Next, enter the email address to be used in the email field, and then click
**Save**. Now that the email address has been entered, emails can be sent to
that alias to create new expenses without having to be in the Konvergo ERP database.

To submit an expense via email, create a new email and enter the product‚Äôs
_internal reference_ code (if available) and the amount of the expense in the
email subject. Next, attach the receipt to the email. Konvergo ERP creates the expense
by taking the information in the email subject and combining it with the
receipt.

To check an expense categories internal reference, go to Expenses app ‚Ä£
Configuration ‚Ä£ Expense Categories. If an internal reference is listed on the
expense category, it is listed in the **Internal Reference** column.

![Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Categories
view.](../../_images/ref.png)

To add an internal reference on an expense category, click on the category to
open the form. Enter the internal reference in the field. Beneath the
**Internal Reference** field, this sentence appears: **Use this reference as a
subject prefix when submitting by email.**

![Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Products
view.](../../_images/mileage-internal-reference.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>For security purposes, only authenticated employee emails are accepted by Konvergo ERP when creating an
expense from an email. To confirm an authenticated employee email address, go to the employee
card in the Employees app, and refer to the <b>Work Email</b></p>

</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">

standard product form in Konvergo ERP, and the information entered is similar. Expense products will be
referred to as expense categories throughout this document since the main menu refers to these as
<b>Expense Categories</b>.</p>
</div>0

## Create an expense report

When expenses are ready to submit (such as at the end of a business trip, or
once a month), an _expense report_ needs to be created. Go to the main
Expenses app dashboard, which displays a default **My Expenses** view, or go
to Expenses app ‚Ä£ My Expenses ‚Ä£ My Expenses.

Expenses are color coded by status. Any expense with a status of **To Report**
(expenses that still need to be added to an expense report) the text appears
in blue. All other statuses (**To Submit** , **Submitted** , and **Approved**)
the text appears in black.

First, select each individual expense for the report by clicking the check box
next to each entry, or quickly select all the expenses in the list by clicking
the check box next to **Expense Date**.

Another way to quickly add all expenses that are not on an expense report is
to click **Create Report** without selecting any expenses, and Konvergo ERP will
select all expenses with a status of **To Submit** that are not already on a
report.

![Select the expenses to submit, then create the
report.](../../_images/create-report.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Expense categories are managed like products in Konvergo ERP. The expense category form follows the
standard product form in Konvergo ERP, and the information entered is similar. Expense products will be
referred to as expense categories throughout this document since the main menu refers to these as
<b>Expense Categories</b>.</p>
</div>1

Once the expenses have been selected, click the **Create Report** button. The
new report appears with all the expenses listed in the **Expense** tab. If
there is a receipt attached to an individual expense, a **üìé (paperclip)** icon
appears next to the **Customer to Reinvoice** and **Analytic Distribution**
columns.

When the report is created, the date range for the expenses appears in the
**Expense Report Summary** field by default. It is recommended to edit this
field with a short summary for each report to help keep expenses organized.
Enter a short description for the expense report (such as `Client Trip NYC`,
or `Repairs for Company Car`) in the **Expense Report Summary** field. Next,
select a **Manager** from the drop-down menu to assign a manager to review the
report. If needed, the **Journal** can be changed. Use the drop-down menu to
select a different **Journal**.

![Enter a short description and select a manager for the
report.](../../_images/expense-report-summary.png)

If some expenses are not on the report that should be, they can still be
added. Click **Add a line** at the bottom of the **Expense** tab. A pop up
appears with all the available expenses that can be added to the report (with
a status of **To Submit**). Click the check box next to each expense to add,
then click **Select**. The items now appear on the report that was just
created. If a new expense needs to be added that does _not_ appear on the
list, click **New** to create a new expense and add it to the report.

![Add more expenses to the report before submitting.](../../_images/add-an-
expense-line.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">

referred to as expense categories throughout this document since the main menu refers to these as
<b>Expense Categories</b>.</p>
</div>2

### Submit an expense report

When an expense report is completed, the next step is to submit the report to
a manager for approval. Reports must be individually submitted, and cannot be
submitted in batches. Open the specific report from the list of expense
reports (if the report is not already open). To view all expense reports, go
to Expenses app ‚Ä£ My Expenses ‚Ä£ My Reports.

If the list is large, grouping the results by status may be helpful since only
reports that have a **To Submit** status need to be submitted, reports with an
**Approved** or **Submitted** status do not.

The **To Submit** expenses are easily identifiable not just from the **To
Submit** status, but the text appears in blue, while the other expenses text
appears in black.

![Submit the report to the manager.](../../_images/expense-status.png)
<div class="alert alert-primary">

<b>Expense Categories</b>.</p>
</div>3

Click on a report to open it, then click **Submit To Manager**. After
submitting a report, the next step is to wait for the manager to approve it.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">

<b>Expense Categories</b>.</p>
</div>4

## Approve expenses

In Konvergo ERP, not just anyone can approve expense reports‚Äî only users with the
necessary rights (or permissions) can. This means that a user must have at
least _Team Approver_ rights for the _Expenses_ app. Employees with the
necessary rights can review expense reports, approve or reject them, and
provide feedback thanks to the integrated communication tool.

To see who has rights to approve, go to the main Settings app and click on
**Manage Users**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Expense categories are managed like products in Konvergo ERP. The expense category form follows the
standard product form in Konvergo ERP, and the information entered is similar. Expense products will be
referred to as expense categories throughout this document since the main menu refers to these as
<b>Expense Categories</b>.</p>
</div>5

Click on an individual to view their card, which displays the **Access
Rights** tab in the default view. Scroll down to the **Human Resources**
section. Under **Expenses** , there are four options:

  * **None (blank)** : A blank field means the user has no rights to view or approve expense reports, and can only view their own.

  * **Team Approver** : The user can only view and approve expense reports for their own specific team.

  * **All Approver** : The user can view and approve any expense report.

  * **Administrator** : The user can view and approve any expense report, as well as access the reporting and configuration menus in the _Expenses_ app.

Users who are able to approve expense reports (typically managers) can easily
view all expense reports they have access rights to. Go to Expenses app ‚Ä£
Expense Reports, and a list appears with all expense reports that have a
status of either **To Submit** , **Submitted** , **Approved** , **Posted** ,
or **Done**. Expense reports with a status of **Refused** are hidden in the
default view.

![Reports to validate are found on the Reports to Approve
page.](../../_images/expense-reports-list.png)

When viewing expense reports, there is a panel of filters that can be enabled
or disabled on the left side. The three categories that filters can be applied
on are **Status** , **Employee** , and **Company**. To view only expense
reports with a particular status, enable the specific status filter to display
the expense reports with only that status. Disable the specific status filter
to hide the reports with that status. To view expense reports for a particular
employee and/or company, enable the specific employee name filter and/or
company filter in the **Employee** and **Company** sections.

Reports can be approved in two ways (individually or several at once) and
refused only one way. To approve multiple expense reports at once, remain in
the list view. First, select the reports to approve by clicking the check box
next to each report, or click the box next to **Employee** to select all the
reports in the list.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">

</div>6

Next, click the **Approve Report** button.

![Approve multiple reports by clicking the checkboxes next to each
report.](../../_images/approve-report.png)

To approve an individual report, click on a report to go to a detailed view of
that report. In this view, several options are presented: **Approve** ,
**Report in Next Payslip** , **Refuse** , or **Reset to draft**. Click
**Approve** to approve the report.

If **Refuse** is clicked, a pop-up window appears. Enter a brief explanation
for the refusal in the **Reason to Refuse Expense** field, and then click
**Refuse**.

![Send messages in the chatter.](../../_images/refuse-expense.png)

Team managers can easily view all the expense reports for their team members.
While in the **Expense Reports** view, click the drop-down arrow in the right-
side of the search box, and click on **My Team** in the **Filters** section.
This presents all the reports for the manager‚Äôs team.

</div>7

## Post expenses in accounting

Once an expense report is approved, the next step is to post the report to the
accounting journal. To view all expense reports, go to Expenses app ‚Ä£ Expense
Reports. To view only the expense reports that have been approved and need to
be posted, adjust the filters on the left side so that only the **Approved**
status is enabled.

![View reports to post by clicking on expense reports, then reports to
post.](../../_images/post-reports.png)

Just like approvals, expense reports can be posted in two ways (individually
or several at once). To post multiple expense reports at once, remain in the
list view. First, select the reports to post by clicking the check box next to
each report, or click the box next to **Employee** to select all the reports
in the list. Next, click **Post Entries**.

![Post multiple reports at a time from the Expense Reports view, with the
Approved filter.](../../_images/post-entries.png)

To post an individual report, click on a report to go to the detailed view of
that report. In this view, several options are presented: **Post Journal
Entries** , **Report In Next Payslip** , **Refuse** , or **Reset to Draft**.
Click **Post Journal Entries** to post the report.

If **Refuse** is clicked, a pop-up window appears. Enter a brief explanation
for the refusal in the **Reason to Refuse Expense** field, and then click
**Refuse**. Refused reports can be viewed by going to Expenses app ‚Ä£ Expense
Reports, then adjusting the filters on the left so that only **Refused** is
selected. This will only show the refused expense reports.

</div>8

## Reimburse employees

After an expense report is posted to an accounting journal, the next step is
to reimburse the employee. To view all the expense reports to pay, go to
Expenses app ‚Ä£ Expense Reports ‚Ä£ Reports To Pay.

![View reports to pay by clicking on expense reports, then reports to
pay.](../../_images/reports-to-pay.png)

Just like approvals and posting, expense reports can be paid in two ways
(individually or several at once). To pay multiple expense reports at once,
remain in the list view. First, select the reports to pay by clicking the
check box next to each report, or click the box next to **Employee** to select
all the reports in the list. Next, click **Register Payment**.

![Post multiple reports by selecting them, clicking the gear, and then post
the entries.](../../_images/register-payment1.png)

To pay an individual report, click on a report to go to a detailed view of
that report. Click **Register Payment** to pay the employee.

A **Register Payment** pop-up appears, and the **Journal** , **Payment
Method** , and **Payment Date** can be modified, if needed. When the
selections are correct, click **Create Payment** to send the payment to the
employee.

To pay an individual report, click on a report in the list view to go to a
detailed view of that report. Click **Register Payment** to pay the employee.
A **Register Payment** pop-up appears, but when paying an individual expense
report instead of several at once, more options appear in the pop-up. In
addition to the **Journal** , **Payment Method** , and **Payment Date**
fields, a **Recipient Bank Account** , **Amount** , and **Memo** field appear.
Select the employee‚Äôs bank account from the drop-down menu to directly deposit
the payment to their account. When all other selections are correct, click
**Create Payment** to send the payment to the employee.

![Different options appear when registering an individual expense report
versus multiple expense reports at once.](../../_images/two-payment-posting-
options.png)

## Re-invoice expenses to customers

If expenses are tracked on customer projects, expenses can be automatically
charged back to the customer. This is done by creating an expense, referencing
the SO the expense should be added to, and then creating the expense report.
Next, managers approve the expense report, and the accounting department posts
the journal entries. Finally, once the expense report is posted to a journal,
the expense(s) appears on the SO that was referenced. The sales order can then
be invoiced, thus invoicing the customer for the expense.

### Setup

First, specify the invoicing policy for each expense category. Go to Expenses
app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Expense Categories. Click on the expense category to
open the expense category form. Under the **Invoicing** section, click the
radio button next to the desired selection for **Re-Invoicing Expenses**.
Options are **None** , **At cost** , and **Sales price**.

**Re-Invoicing Expenses** :

  * **None** : Expense category will not be re-invoiced.

  * **At cost** : Expense category will invoice expenses at their real cost.

  * **At sales price** : Expense category will invoice the price set on the sale order.

### Create an expense

First, when creating a new expense, the correct information needs to be
entered in order to re-invoice a customer. Select the _sales order_ the
expense will appear on in the **Customer to Reinvoice** section, from the
drop-down menu. Next, select the **Analytic Account** the expense will be
posted to. After the expense(s) are created, the expense report needs to be
created and submitted as usual.

![Ensure the customer to be invoiced is called out on the
expense.](../../_images/reinvoice-expense.png) <div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Expense categories are managed like products in Konvergo ERP. The expense category form follows the
standard product form in Konvergo ERP, and the information entered is similar. Expense products will be
referred to as expense categories throughout this document since the main menu refers to these as
<b>Expense Categories</b>.</p>
</div>9

### Validate and post expenses

Only employees with permissions (typically managers or supervisors) can
approve expenses. Before approving an expense report, ensure the **Analytic
Distribution** is set on every expense line of a report. If an **Analytic
Distribution** is missing, assign the correct account(s) from the drop-down
menu, and then click **Approve** or **Refuse**.

The accounting department is typically responsible for posting journal
entries. Once an expense report is approved, it can then be posted. The SO is
**only** updated _after the journal entries are posted_. One the journal
entries are posted, the expenses now appear on the referenced SO.

### Invoice expenses

Once the SO has been updated, it is time to invoice the customer. After the
expense report has been approved and the journal entries have been posted,
click the **Sales Orders** smart button to open the SO. The expenses to be re-
invoiced are now on the SO.
