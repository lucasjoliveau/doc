# Wire transfers

The **Wire transfer** payment method allows you to provide payment
instructions to your customers, such as the bank details and communication.
They are displayed:

  * at the end of the checkout process, once the customer has selected **Wire transfer** as a payment method and clicked the **Pay now** button:

  * on the customer portal:

<li><p>While this method is very accessible and requires minimal setup, it is very inefficient
process-wise. We recommend setting up a <a href="../payment_providers">payment provider</a> instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Online orders remain in the <b>Quotation sent</b> (i.e., unpaid order) stage until you
receive the payment and <b>Confirm</b> the order.</p></li>

manually, such as checks, by renaming or duplicating it.</p>

## Configuration

To configure **Wire Transfer** , go to Accounting / Website ‣ Configuration ‣
Payment Providers, and open the **Wire Transfer** card. Then, in the
**Configuration** tab:

  * Select the **Communication** to be used;

    * **Based on Document Reference** : sales order or invoice number

    * **Based on Customer ID** : customer identifier

  * Tick the **Enable QR codes** check box to activate [QR code payments](../accounting/customer_invoices/epc_qr_code).

Define the payment instructions in the **Messages** tab:

![Define payment instructions](../../../_images/payment_instructions.png)

If you have already defined [a bank account](../accounting/bank), the
account number will be automatically added to the default message generated by
Konvergo ERP.
