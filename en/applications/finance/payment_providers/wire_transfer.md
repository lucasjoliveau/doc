# Wire transfers

The **Wire transfer** payment method allows you to provide payment
instructions to your customers, such as the bank details and communication.
They are displayed:

  * at the end of the checkout process, once the customer has selected Wire transfer as a payment method and clicked the Pay now button:

  * on the customer portal:

portal](../../../_images/payment_instructions_portal.png)

Note

  * While this method is very accessible and requires minimal setup, it is very inefficient process-wise. We recommend setting up a [payment provider](../payment_providers.html) instead.

  * Online orders remain in the Quotation sent (i.e., unpaid order) stage until you receive the payment and Confirm the order.

Tip

**Wire transfer** can be used as a template for other payment methods that are
processed manually, such as checks, by renaming or duplicating it.

## Configuration

To configure **Wire Transfer** , go to Accounting / Website ‣ Configuration ‣
Payment Providers, and open the Wire Transfer card. Then, in the Configuration
tab:

  * Select the Communication to be used;

    * Based on Document Reference: sales order or invoice number

    * Based on Customer ID: customer identifier

  * Tick the Enable QR codes check box to activate [QR code payments](../accounting/customer_invoices/epc_qr_code.html).

Define the payment instructions in the Messages tab:

![Define payment instructions](../../../_images/payment_instructions.png)

If you have already defined [a bank account](../accounting/bank.html), the
account number will be automatically added to the default message generated by
Odoo.
