### Credentials tab

Odoo needs your **API Credentials** to connect with your Mollie account, which
comprise:

  * **API Key** : The test or live API Key depending on the configuration of the provider.

You can copy your credentials from your Mollie account, and paste them in the
related fields under the **Credentials** tab.

To retrieve your API key, log into your Mollie account, go to Developers â€£ API
keys, and copy your Test or Live **API Key**.

Important

If you are trying Mollie as a test, with the Test API key, change the
**State** to _Test Mode_. We recommend doing this on a test Odoo database,
rather than on your main database.
