comprise:

  * **API Key** : The test or live API Key depending on the configuration of the provider.

You can copy your credentials from your Mollie account, and paste them in the
related fields under the **Credentials** tab.

Important</p><p>If you are trying Mollie as a test, with the Test API key, change the <b>State</b> to <em>Test Mode</em>.
We recommend doing this on a test Konvergo ERP database, rather than on your main database.</p>
