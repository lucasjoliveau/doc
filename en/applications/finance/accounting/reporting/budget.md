# Financial budget

Managing budgets is an essential part of running a business. Budgets help
people become more intentional with how money is spent and direct people to
organize and prioritize their work to meet financial goals. They allow the
planning of a desired financial outcome and then measure the actual
performance against the plan. Konvergo ERP manages budgets using both **general** and
**analytic accounts**.

## Configuration

Go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Analytics section, and enable
**Budget Management**.

### Budgetary positions

Budgetary positions are lists of accounts for which you want to keep budgets
(typically expense or income accounts).

To define budgetary positions, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Management:
Budgetary Positions and **New**. Add a **Name** to your budgetary position and
select the **Company** it applies to. Click **Add a line** to add one or more
accounts.

must have at least one.</p>

## Use case

Let’s illustrate this with an example.

We just started a project with _Smith & Co_, and we would like to budget the
income and expenses of that project. We plan on having a revenue of 1000, and
we don’t want to spend more than 700.

First, we need to define what accounts relate to our project’s expenses. Go to
Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Management: Budgetary positions, and click
**New** to add a position. Add the accounts wherein expenses will be booked.

expenses.png)

Let’s repeat the steps to create a budgetary position that reflects the
revenue.

### Analytical accounts

Konvergo ERP needs to know which costs or expenses are relevant to a specified budget,
as the above general accounts may be used for different projects. Go to
Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Analytic Accounting: Analytic Accounts and click
**New** to add a new **Analytic Account** called _Smith & Co_.

The **Plan** field has to be completed. Plans group multiple analytic
accounts; they distribute costs and benefits to analyze business performance.
**Analytic Plans** can be created or configured by going to Accounting ‣
Configuration ‣ Analytic Accounting: Analytic Plans.

When creating a new customer invoice and/or vendor bill, you have to refer to
this analytic account.

### Define the budget

Let’s set our targets. We specified that we expect to gain 1000 with this
project, and we would like not to spend more than 700. Go to Accounting ‣
Management: Budgets and click **New** to create a new budget for _Smith & Co_
project.

First, fill in your **Budget Name**. Then, select the **Period** wherein the
budget is applicable. Next, add the **Budgetary Position** you want to track,
define the related **Analytic Account** , and add the **Planned Amount**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>When recording a planned amount related to expenses, the amount must be negative.</p>
</div>

### Check your budget

Go to Accounting ‣ Management: Budgets and find the _Smith & Co_ Project to
see how it evolves according to the expenses or income for the related
analytic account.

The **Practical Amount** evolves when a new journal entry related to your
analytic account and an account from your budgetary position is created.

The **Theoretical Amount** represents the amount of money you theoretically
could have spent or should have received based on the date. For example,
suppose your budget is 1200 for 12 months (January to December), and today is
31 of January. In that case, the theoretical amount will be 100 since this is
the actual amount that could have been made.
