# Chart of accounts

The **chart of accounts (COA)** is the list of all the accounts used to record
financial transactions in the general ledger of an organization. The chart of
accounts can be found under Accounting‣Configuration‣Chart of Accounts.

When browsing your chart of accounts, you can sort the accounts by **Code** ,
**Account Name** , or **Type** , but other options are available in the drop-
down menu **(⋮)**.

## Configuration of an account

The country you select during the creation of your database (or additional
company in your database) determines which [fiscal localization
package](../../fiscal_localizations) is installed by default. This
package includes a standard chart of accounts already configured according to
the country’s regulations. You can use it directly or set it according to your
company’s needs.

To create a new account, go to Accounting‣Configuration‣Chart of Accounts,
click **Create** , and fill in (at the minimum) the required fields (**Code,
Account Name, Type**).

</div>

### Code and name

Each account is identified by its **Code** and **Name** , which also indicate
the account’s purpose.

### Type

Correctly configuring the **account type** is critical as it serves multiple
purposes:

  * Information on the account’s purpose and behavior

  * Generate country-specific legal and financial reports

  * Set the rules to close a fiscal year

  * Generate opening entries

To configure an account type, open the **Type** field’s drop-down selector and
select the corresponding type from the following list:

Report | Category | Account Types  
---|---|---  
Balance Sheet | Assets | Receivable  
Bank and Cash  
Current Assets  
Non-current Assets  
Prepayments  
Fixed Assets  
Liabilities | Payable  
Credit Card  
Current Liabilities  
Non-current Liabilities  
Equity | Equity  
Current Year Earnings  
Profit & Loss | Income | Income  
Other Income  
Expense | Expense  
Depreciation  
Cost of Revenue  
Other | Other | Off-Balance Sheet  
  
#### Assets, deferred expenses, and deferred revenues automation

Some **account types** can **automate** the creation of
[assets](../vendor_bills/assets#assets-automation) entries, [deferred
expenses](../vendor_bills/deferred_expenses#deferred-expenses-automation)
entries, and [deferred
revenues](../customer_invoices/deferred_revenues#deferred-revenues-
automation) entries. To **automate** entries, click **Setup** on an account
line and go to the **Automation** tab.

You have three choices for the **Automation** tab:

  1. **No** : this is the default value. Nothing happens.

  2. **Create in draft** : whenever a transaction is posted on the account, a draft entry is created but not validated. You must first fill out the corresponding form.

  3. **Create and validate** : you must also select a **Deferred Expense Model**. Whenever a transaction is posted on the account, an entry is created and immediately validated.

### Default taxes

In the **Setup** menu of an account, select a **default tax** to be applied
when this account is chosen for a product sale or purchase.

### Tags

Some accounting reports require **tags** to be set on the relevant accounts.
To add a tag, under **Setup** , click the **Tags** field and select an
existing tag or **Create** a new one.

### Account groups

**Account groups** are useful to list multiple accounts as _sub-accounts_ of a
bigger account and thus consolidate reports such as the **Trial Balance**. By
default, groups are handled automatically based on the code of the group. For
example, a new account `131200` is going to be part of the group `131000`. You
can attribute a specific group to an account in the **Group** field under
**Setup**.

#### Create account groups manually

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Regular users should not need to create account groups manually. The following section is only
intended for rare and advanced use cases.</p>
</div>

To create a new account group, activate [developer
mode](../../../general/developer_mode#developer-mode) and head to
Accounting app‣Configuration‣Account Groups. Here, create a new group and
enter the **name, code prefix, and company** to which that group account
should be available. Note that you must enter the same code prefix in both
**From** and **to** fields.

To display your **Trial Balance** report with your account groups, go to
Accounting‣Reporting‣Trial Balance, then open the **Options** menu and select
**Hierarchy and Subtotals**.

### Allow reconciliation

Some accounts, such as accounts made to record the transactions of a payment
method, can be used for the reconciliation of journal entries.

For example, an invoice paid with a credit card can be marked as **paid** if
reconciled with its payment. Therefore, the account used to record credit card
payments needs to be configured as **allowing reconciliation**.

To do so, check the **Allow Reconciliation** box in the account’s settings,
and **Save** ; or enable the button from the chart of accounts view.

### Deprecated

It is not possible to delete an account once a transaction has been recorded
on it. You can make them unusable by using the **Deprecated** feature: check
the **Deprecated** box in the account’s settings, and **Save**.
