# Multi-currency system

Odoo allows you to issue invoices, receive bills, and record transactions in
currencies other than the main currency configured for your company. You can
also set up bank accounts in other currencies and run reports on your foreign
currency activities.

## Configuration

### Main currency

The **main currency** is defined by default according to the company’s
country. You can change it by going to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣
Currencies and changing the currency in the Main Currency setting.

### Enable foreign currencies

Go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Currencies, and enable the currencies you
wish to use by toggling the Active button.

### Currency rates

#### Manual update

To manually create and set a currency rate, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣
Currencies, click on the currency you wish to change the rate of, and under
the Rates tab, click Add a line to create a new rate.

#### Automatic update

When you activate a second currency for the first time, Automatic Currency
Rates appears under Accounting Dashboard ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣
Currencies. By default, you have to click on the **Update now** button (🗘) to
update the rates.

Odoo can update the rates at regular intervals. To do so, change the Interval
from Manually to Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. You can also select the web
service from which you want to retrieve the latest currency rates by clicking
on the Service field.

### Exchange difference entries

Odoo automatically records exchange differences entries on dedicated accounts,
in a dedicated journal.

You can define which journal and accounts to use to **post exchange difference
entries** by going to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Default Accounts
and editing the Journal, Gain Account, and Loss Account.

Example

If you receive a payment for a customer invoice one month after it was issued,
the exchange rate has likely changed since. Therefore, this fluctuation
implies some profit or loss due to the exchange difference, which Odoo
automatically records in the default **Exchange Difference** journal.

### Chart of accounts

Each account can have a set currency. By doing so, all moves relevant to the
account are forced to have that account’s currency.

To do so, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Charts of Accounts and select a
currency in the field Account Currency. If left empty, all active currencies
are handled instead of just one.

### Journals

If a currency is set on a **journal** , that journal only handles transactions
in that currency.

To do so, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Journals, open the journal you
want to edit, and select a currency in the field Currency.

## Multi-currency accounting

### Invoices, bills, and other documents

For all documents, you can select the currency and journal to use for the
transaction on the document itself.

![Select the currency and journal to use.](../../../../_images/currency-
field.png)

### Payment registration

To register a payment in a currency other than your company’s main currency,
click on the Register Payment payment button of your document and, in the pop-
up window, select a **currency** in the Amount field.

![Select the currency and journal to use before registering the
payment.](../../../../_images/register-payment.png)

### Bank transactions

When creating or importing bank transactions, the amount is in the company’s
main currency. To input a **foreign currency** , select a currency in the
Foreign Currency. Once selected, enter the Amount in your main currency for it
to automatically get converted in the foreign currency in the Amount in
Currency field.

currencies.](../../../../_images/foreign-fields.png)

When reconciling, Odoo displays both the foreign currency amount and the
equivalent amount in your company’s main currency.

### Exchange rate journal entries

To see **exchange difference journal entries** , go to Accounting Dashboard ‣
Accounting ‣ Journals: Miscellaneous.
