# Multi-currency system

Konvergo ERP allows you to issue invoices, receive bills, and record transactions in
currencies other than the main currency configured for your company. You can
also set up bank accounts in other currencies and run reports on your foreign
currency activities.

## Configuration

### Main currency

The **main currency** is defined by default according to the companyâ€™s
country. You can change it by going to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Settings â€£
Currencies and changing the currency in the **Main Currency** setting.

### Enable foreign currencies

Go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Currencies, and enable the currencies you
wish to use by toggling the **Active** button.

currencies.png)

### Currency rates

#### Manual update

To manually create and set a currency rate, go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£
Currencies, click on the currency you wish to change the rate of, and under
the **Rates** tab, click **Add a line** to create a new rate.

![Create or modify the currency rate.](../../../../_images/manual-rate-
update.png)

#### Automatic update

When you activate a second currency for the first time, **Automatic Currency
Rates** appears under Accounting Dashboard â€£ Configuration â€£ Settings â€£
Currencies. By default, you have to click on the **Update now** button (**ðŸ—˜**)
to update the rates.

Konvergo ERP can update the rates at regular intervals. To do so, change the
**Interval** from **Manually** to **Daily** , **Weekly** , or **Monthly**. You
can also select the web service from which you want to retrieve the latest
currency rates by clicking on the **Service** field.

### Exchange difference entries

Konvergo ERP automatically records exchange differences entries on dedicated accounts,
in a dedicated journal.

You can define which journal and accounts to use to **post exchange difference
entries** by going to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Settings â€£ Default Accounts
and editing the **Journal** , **Gain Account** , and **Loss Account**.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>If you receive a payment for a customer invoice one month after it was issued, the exchange rate
has likely changed since. Therefore, this fluctuation implies some profit or loss due to the
exchange difference, which Konvergo ERP automatically records in the default <b>Exchange Difference</b>
journal.</p>
</div>

### Chart of accounts

Each account can have a set currency. By doing so, all moves relevant to the
account are forced to have that accountâ€™s currency.

To do so, go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Charts of Accounts and select a
currency in the field **Account Currency**. If left empty, all active
currencies are handled instead of just one.

### Journals

If a currency is set on a **journal** , that journal only handles transactions
in that currency.

To do so, go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Journals, open the journal you
want to edit, and select a currency in the field **Currency**.

![Select the currency for the journal to handle.](../../../../_images/journal-
currency.png)

## Multi-currency accounting

### Invoices, bills, and other documents

For all documents, you can select the currency and journal to use for the
transaction on the document itself.

![Select the currency and journal to use.](../../../../_images/currency-
field.png)

### Payment registration

To register a payment in a currency other than your companyâ€™s main currency,
click on the **Register Payment** payment button of your document and, in the
pop-up window, select a **currency** in the **Amount** field.

![Select the currency and journal to use before registering the
payment.](../../../../_images/register-payment.png)

### Bank transactions

When creating or importing bank transactions, the amount is in the companyâ€™s
main currency. To input a **foreign currency** , select a currency in the
**Foreign Currency**. Once selected, enter the **Amount** in your main
currency for it to automatically get converted in the foreign currency in the
**Amount in Currency field**.

![The extra fields related to foreign
currencies.](../../../../_images/foreign-fields.png)

When reconciling, Konvergo ERP displays both the foreign currency amount and the
equivalent amount in your companyâ€™s main currency.

### Exchange rate journal entries

To see **exchange difference journal entries** , go to Accounting Dashboard â€£
Accounting â€£ Journals: Miscellaneous.
