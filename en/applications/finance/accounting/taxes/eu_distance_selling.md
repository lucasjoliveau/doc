# EU intra-community distance selling

EU intra-community distance selling involves the cross-border trade of goods
and services from vendors registered for VAT purposes to individuals (B2C)
located in a European Union member state. The transaction is conducted
remotely, typically through online platforms, mail orders, telephone, or other
means of communication.

EU intra-community distance selling is subject to specific VAT rules and
regulations. The vendor must charge VAT per the VAT rate applicable in the
buyer’s country.

## One-Stop Shop (OSS)

The OSS system introduced by the European Union simplifies VAT collection for
**cross-border** sales of goods and services. It primarily applies to
business-to-consumer **(B2C)** cases. With the OSS, businesses can register
for VAT in their home country and use a single online portal to handle VAT
obligations for their sales within the EU. There are **two primary schemes** :
the **Union OSS** scheme for cross-border services and the **Import OSS**
scheme for goods valued at or below €150.

### Reports

To generate **OSS sales** or **OSS imports** reports and submit them onto the
OSS portal, go to Accounting ‣ Reporting ‣ Tax Report, click **Report: Generic
Tax report** , and select either **OSS Sales** or **OSS Imports**. Once
selected, click on **PDF** , **XLSX** , or **XML** in the top-left corner.
This generates the currently-opened report in the selected format. Once
generated, log into the platform of your competent federal authority to submit
it onto the OSS portal.
