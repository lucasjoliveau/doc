# TaxCloud integration

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>The Konvergo ERP TaxCloud integration has begun its decommissioning, starting in Konvergo ERP 17. New
installations are prohibited in Konvergo ERP 17. In Konvergo ERP 18, the TaxCloud module(s) will <b>not</b> exist at
all. Konvergo ERP recommends the use of the Avatax platform, instead.</p>

TaxCloud calculates the sales tax rate in real time for every state, city, and
special jurisdiction in the United States. It keeps track of which products
are exempt from sales tax, and in which states each exemption applies.

## TaxCloud registration

Register an account on [TaxCloud.com](https://taxcloud.com/register) and
complete the setup. Once you go live, get the **TaxCloud API Keys** by
clicking on **Stores** , then **Get Details**.

![Example of a store's TaxCloud API Keys](../../../../_images/taxcloud-api-
keys.png)

## Enable TaxCloud

  1. Go to Accounting Dashboard â€£ Configuration â€£ Settings and in the **Taxes** section enable **TaxCloud**.

  2. Add the storeâ€™s **Login ID** under **API ID** and the storeâ€™s **Key** under **API KEY**. Click on **Save**.

  3. Click the **Refresh** button (**ðŸ—˜**) next to **Default Category** to import the TIC Taxability Information Codes product categories from TaxCloud. Some categories may imply specific tax rates or exemptions.

  4. Select a **Default Category** and **Save**. The **Default Category** is applied when no **TaxCloud Category** is set on your products or product categories, or when no product is found on an order/invoice.

## Set TaxCloud categories on products

If you need to use more than one TIC category (i.e., the **Default
Category**), go to the productâ€™s **General Information** tab and select a
**TaxCloud Category**.

If you want to configure multiple products simultaneously, ensure they share
the same **Product Category** and click on the external link button (**ðŸ¡•**) to
set a **TaxCloud Category** on the **Product Category** instead.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>If you set a <b>TaxCloud Category</b> on a product and another on its <b>Product
Category</b>, Konvergo ERP only considers the <b>TaxCloud Category</b> found on the product itself.</p>
<p>A <b>TaxCloud Category</b> set on a <b>parent product category</b> does not apply to its
<b>child product categories</b>. For example, if you set <b>TaxCloud Category</b> on the <em>All</em>
<b>Product Category</b>, it is not applied to the <em>All/Sales</em> <b>Product Category</b>.</p>
</div> <div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>Make sure your company address is complete, including the state and the ZIP code. Go to
Settings â€£ Companies: Update Info to open and edit your company address.</p>
</div>

## Automatically post taxes in the correct tax payable account

To make sure the new taxes generated by the TaxCloud integration are created
with the correct **Tax Payable** account, create a **user-defined default**.
This process should be repeated for each one of your companies that uses
TaxCloud.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>A user-defined default impacts all records at creation. It means that <b>every</b> new tax is
set up to record income in the specified Tax Payable account unless the tax is manually edited to
specify a different income account (or if another user-defined default takes precedence).</p>
</div>

To do so, go to Accounting Dashboard â€£ Configuration â€£ Accounting: Chart of
Accounts, find the companyâ€™s **Tax Payable** account, and click on **Setup**.
Take note of the number after `id=` in the URL string; it is the **Tax Payable
account ID** and will be used later.

![Example of Tax Payable account id in the URL
string](../../../../_images/tax-payable-id.png)

Activate the [developer mode](../../../general/developer_mode#developer-
mode), then go to Settings â€£ Technical â€£ Actions: User-defined Defaults and
click on **Create**.

Click on **Field** drop-down menu and then on **Search Moreâ€¦**.

![User-defined Defaults Field search](../../../../_images/user-defaults-
search-more.png)

Use the search bar to filter for the **Tax Repartition Line** model, and use
it a second time to filter for the **Account** field. Select the line with
**Tax Repartition Line** under the **Model** column.

![Searching for the Tax Repartition Line model and Account
field](../../../../_images/user-defaults-search-filters.png)

Once you are back to the **User-defined Defaults** creation, enter the **Tax
Payable account ID** you took note of earlier under the **Default Value (JSON
format)** field.

Select the company for which this configuration should apply under the
**Company** field and click **Save**.

defaults-complete-configuration.png)

## Automatically detect the fiscal position

Sales taxes are calculated in Konvergo ERP based on [fiscal
positions](fiscal_positions). A fiscal position for the United States is
created when enabling TaxCloud.

You can configure Konvergo ERP to automatically detect to which customers the fiscal
position should be applied. To do so, go to Accounting Dashboard â€£
Configuration â€£ Accounting: Fiscal Positions and select **Automatic Tax
Mapping (TaxCloud)**. Enable **Detect Automatically** and then **Save**.

![Detect Automatically setting on the TaxCloud fiscal
position](../../../../_images/fiscal-position-detect.png)

Now, this fiscal position is automatically set on any order or invoice if the
customer country is _United States_. This triggers the automated tax
computation.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>To get the sales taxes on a sales order, confirm it or click the <b>Update Taxes</b> button
next to <b>Add Shipping</b>.</p>
</div>

## Interaction with coupons and promotions

If you use the **Coupon** or **Promotion Programs** , the integration with
TaxCloud might behave unexpectedly. Indeed, as TaxCloud does not accept lines
with negative amounts as part of the tax computation, the amount of the lines
added by the promotion program must be deduced from the total of the lines it
impacts.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>This means, amongst other complications, that orders using coupons or promotions with a TaxCloud
fiscal position <b>must</b> be invoiced completely - you cannot create invoices for partial
deliveries, etc.</p>
</div>

Another unexpected behavior is possible. For example, you sell a product for
which you have a promotion program that provides a 50% discount. If the
productâ€™s tax rate is 7%, the tax rate computed from the TaxCloud integration
displays 3.5%. This happens because the discount is included in the price sent
to TaxCloud. However, in Konvergo ERP, the discount is on another line entirely.
Still, the tax computation is correct. Indeed, a 3.5% tax on the full price is
the equivalent of a 7% tax on half the price, but this might be unexpected
from a user point of view.
