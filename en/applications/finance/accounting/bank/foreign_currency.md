# Manage a bank account in a foreign currency

In Konvergo ERP, every transaction is recorded in the default currency of the company,
and reports are all based on that default currency. When you have a bank
account in a foreign currency, for every transaction, Konvergo ERP stores two values:

  * The debit/credit in the currency of the _company_ ;

  * The debit/credit in the currency of the _bank account_.

Currency rates are updated automatically using the web services of a banking
institution. By default, Konvergo ERP uses the European Central Bankâ€™s web services
but other options are available.

## Configuration

### Activate multi-currencies

To work with multiple currencies, go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Settings
â€£ Currencies and tick **Multi-Currencies**. Under **Post Exchange difference
entries in:** , provide a **Journal** , a **Gain Account** , a **Loss
Account** , and then click on **Save**.

### Configure currencies

Once Konvergo ERP is configured to support multiple currencies, they are all created
by default, but not necessarily active. To activate the new currencies, click
on **Activate Other Currencies** under the **Multi-Currencies** setting or go
to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Accounting: Currencies.

When the currencies are activated, you can choose to **automate** the currency
rate update, or leave it on **manual**. To configure the rate update, go back
to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Settings â€£ Currencies, check **Automatic
Currency Rates** , set **Interval** to your desired frequency, and then click
on **Save**. You also have the option to choose the **Service** you wish to
obtain currency rates from.

Click on the Update now button (**ðŸ—˜**) besides the **Next Run** field to
update the currency rates manually.

### Create a new bank account

In the accounting application, go to Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Journals and
create a new one. Enter a **Journal Name** and set the **Type** to `Bank`. In
the **Journal Entries** tab, enter a **short code** , a **currency** , and
then finally click on the **Bank Account** field to create a new account. In
the pop-up window of the account creation, enter a name, a code (ex.: 550007),
set its type to `Bank and Cash`, set a currency type, and save. When you are
back on the **journal** , click on the **Account Number** field, and in the
pop-up window, fill out the **Account Number** , **Bank** of your account, and
save.

Upon creation of the journal, Konvergo ERP automatically links the bank account to the
journal. It can be found under Accounting â€£ Configuration â€£ Accounting: Chart
of Accounts.

## Vendor bill in a foreign currency

To pay a bill in a foreign currency, simply select the currency next to the
**Journal** field and register the payment. Konvergo ERP automatically creates and
posts the foreign **exchange gain or loss** as a new journal entry.

converts between the two currencies.</p>

## Unrealized Currency Gains/Losses Report

This report gives an overview of all unrealized amounts in a foreign currency
on your balance sheet, and allows you to adjust an entry or manually set an
exchange rate. To access this report, go to Reporting â€£ Management: Unrealized
Currency Gains/Losses. From here, you have access to all open entries in your
**balance sheet**.

If you wish to use a different currency rate than the one set in Accounting â€£
Configuration â€£ Settings â€£ Currencies, click the **Exchange Rates** button and
change the rate of the foreign currencies in the report.

When manually changing **exchange rates** , a yellow banner appears allowing
you to reset back to Konvergo ERPâ€™s rate. To do so, simply click on **Reset to Konvergo ERPâ€™s
Rate**.

In order to update your **balance sheet** with the amount of the
**adjustment** column, click on the **Adjustment Entry** button. In the pop-up
window, select a **Journal** , **Expense Account** and **Income Account** to
calculate and process the **unrealized gains and losses**.

You can set the date of the report in the **Date** field. Konvergo ERP automatically
reverses the booking entry to the date set in **Reversal Date**.

Once posted, the **adjustment** column should indicate `0.00`, meaning all
**unrealized gains/losses** have been adjusted.
