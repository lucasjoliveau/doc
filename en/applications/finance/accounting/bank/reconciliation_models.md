# Reconciliation models

Reconciliation models are used to automate the [bank
reconciliation](reconciliation.html) process, which is especially handy when
dealing with recurring entries like bank fees. Reconciliation models can also
be helpful in handling [cash
discounts](../customer_invoices/cash_discounts.html).

Each model is created based on a model type and bank transaction conditions.

## Reconciliation model types

The reconciliation models are available by going to Accounting ‣ Configuration
‣ Banks: Reconciliation Models. For each reconciliation model, a Type must be
set. Three types of models exist:

  * Button to generate counterpart entry: a button is created in the resulting entry section of the bank reconciliation view. If clicked, this button generates a counterpart entry to reconcile with the active transaction based on the rules set in the model. The rules specified in the model determine the counterpart entry’s account(s), amount(s), label(s), and analytic distribution;

  * Rule to suggest counterpart entry: used for recurring transactions to match the transaction to a new entry based on conditions that must match the information on the transaction;

  * Rule to match invoices/bills: used for recurring transactions to match the transaction to existing invoices, bills, or payments based on conditions that must match the information on the transaction.

## Default reconciliation models

In Odoo, different models are available by default depending on the company’s
fiscal localization. These can be updated if needed. Users can also create
their own reconciliation models by clicking New.

Important

If a record matches with several reconciliation models, the first one in the
_sequence_ of models is applied. You can rearrange the order by dragging and
dropping the handle next to the name.

### Invoices/Bills perfect match

This model should be at the top of the _sequence_ of models, as it enables
Odoo to suggest matching existing invoices or bills with a bank transaction
based on set conditions.

bills-perfect-match.png)

Odoo automatically reconciles the payment when the Auto-validate option is
selected, and the model conditions are perfectly met. In this case, it expects
to find on the bank statement’s line the invoice/payment’s reference (as Label
is selected) and the partner’s name (as Partner is set is selected) to suggest
the correct counterpart entry and reconcile the payment automatically.

### Invoices/Bills partial match if underpaid

This model suggests a customer invoice or vendor bill that partially matches
the payment when the amount received is slightly lower than the invoice
amount, for example in the case of **cash discounts**. The difference is
reconciled with the account indicated in the counterpart entries tab.

The reconciliation model Type is Rule to match invoices/bills, and the Payment
tolerance should be set.

match.png)

Note

The Payment tolerance is only applicable to lower payments. It is disregarded
when an overpayment is received.

### Line with bank fees

This model suggests a counterpart entry according to the rules set in the
model. In this case, the reconciliation model Type is Rule to suggest
counterpart entry, and the Label can be used for example, to identify the
information referring to the Bank fees in the label of the transaction.

Note

[Regular expressions](https://regexone.com/), often abbreviated as **Regex** ,
can be used in Odoo in various ways to search, validate, and manipulate data
within the system. Regex can be powerful but also complex, so it’s essential
to use it judiciously and with a good understanding of the patterns you’re
working with.

To use regular expressions in your reconciliation models, set the Transaction
Type to Match Regex and add your expression. Odoo automatically retrieves the
transactions that match your Regex expression and the conditions specified in
your model.

## Partner mapping

Partner mapping allows you to establish rules for automatically matching
transactions to the correct partner account, saving time and reducing the risk
of errors that can occur during manual reconciliation. For example, you can
create a partner mapping rule for incoming payments with specific reference
numbers or keywords in the transaction description. When an incoming payment
meets these criteria, Odoo automatically maps it to the corresponding
customer’s account.

To create a partner mapping rule, go to the Partner Mapping tab and enter the
Find Text in Label, Find Text in Notes, and Partner.
