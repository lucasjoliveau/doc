# Cash rounding

**Cash rounding** is required when the lowest physical denomination of
currency, or the smallest coin, is higher than the minimum unit of account.

For example, some countries require their companies to round up or down the
total amount of an invoice to the nearest five cents, when the payment is made
in cash.

## Configuration

Go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings and enable _Cash Rounding_ , then
click on _Save_.

Go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Cash Roundings, and click on _Create_.

Define here your _Rounding Precision_ , _Rounding Strategy_ , and _Rounding
Method_.

Konvergo ERP supports two **rounding strategies** :

  1. **Add a rounding line** : a _rounding_ line is added on the invoice. You have to define which account records the cash roundings.

  2. **Modify tax amount** : the rounding is applied in the taxes section.

## Apply roundings

When editing a draft invoice, open the _Other Info_ tab, go to the _Accounting
Information_ section, and select the appropriate _Cash Rounding Method_.
