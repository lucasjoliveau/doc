# Incoterms

Incoterms are standardized trade terms used in international transactions to
define the rights and responsibilities of buyers and sellers. They establish
the obligations related to the delivery of goods, the transfer of risks, and
the distribution of costs between the parties involved. Incoterms specify
important details, such as the point at which the risk and costs transfer from
the seller to the buyer, the responsibility for transportation, insurance,
customs clearance, and other relevant aspects of the transaction.
