# Default terms and conditions (T&C)

Specifying terms and conditions is essential to establish important
contractual points, such as return and refunds, warranty, and after-sale
services.

You can add default terms and conditions at the bottom of all customer
invoices, sales orders, and quotations, either as text or a link to a web
page.

a note in your document.
