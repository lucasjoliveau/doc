# Pay by checks

Once you decide to pay a supplier bill, you can select to pay by check. You
can then print all the payments registered by check. Finally, the bank
reconciliation process will match the checks you sent to suppliers with actual
bank statements.

## Configuration

### Activate checks payment methods

To activate the checks payment method, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣
Settings, and scroll down to the **Vendor Payments** section. There, you can
activate the payment method as well as set up the **Check Layout**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><ul>
<li><p>Once the <b>Checks</b> setting is activated, the <b>Checks</b> payment method is
automatically set up in the <b>Outgoing Payments</b> tabs of <b>bank</b> journals.</p></li>
<li><p>Some countries require specific modules to print checks; such modules may be installed by
default. For instance, the <b>U.S. Checks Layout</b> module is required to print U.S.
checks.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

## Pay a supplier bill with a check

Paying a supplier with a check is done in three steps:

  1. registering a payment

  2. printing checks in batch for all registered payments

  3. reconciling bank statements

### Register a payment by check

To register a payment, open any supplier bill from the menu Purchases ‣ Vendor
Bills. Once the supplier bill is validated, you can register a payment. Set
the **Payment Method** to **Checks** and validate the payment.

### Print checks

On your **Accounting Dashboard** in the **Bank** Journal, you can see the
number of checks registered. By clicking on **Checks to print** you have got
the possibility to print the reconciled checks.

To print all checks in batch, select all payments from the list view and click
on **Print**.
