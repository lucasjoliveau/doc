# Internal transfers

In Odoo, internal money transfers can be made in a few clicks. You need at
least either two bank accounts, two cash journals, or one bank account and one
cash journal.

## Configuration

An internal transfer account is automatically created on your database based
on your company’s localization and depending on your country’s legislation. If
needed, the default Internal transfer account can be modified by going to
Accounting app ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings and then under the Default Accounts
section.

Note

At least two bank accounts are needed to make internal transfers. Refer to
[Bank and cash accounts section](../bank.html) to see how to add an additional
bank account to your database.

## Register an internal transfer from one bank to another

Let’s say you have two bank accounts registered on your database and you want
to transfer 1,000 USD from Bank A to Bank B.

### Log an internal transfer

From the Accounting Dashboard, click on the drop-down selection button (⋮) on
one of your banks. In the New column click on Internal Transfer and enter the
information related to the transfer.

transfer](../../../../_images/internal_transfer.png)

Note

Fill in the Memo field for automatic reconciliation.

Save and Confirm to register your internal transfer. The money is now booked
in the transfer account and another payment is **automatically** created in
the destination journal (Bank B).

#### Bank journal (Bank A)

**Account** | **Debit** | **Credit**  
---|---|---  
Outstanding Payments account |  | $1,000  
**Internal transfer account** | **$1,000** |   
  
#### Automated booking - Bank journal (BANK B)

**Account** | **Debit** | **Credit**  
---|---|---  
Outstanding Receipts account | $1,000 |   
**Internal transfer account** |  | **$1,000**  
  
Note

There are one outstanding payment and one outstanding receipt pending in your
two bank account journals, because the bank statement confirming the sending
and receiving of the money has not been booked yet.

### Manage and reconcile bank statements

The next step is to book the bank statements to finalize the transaction by
creating, [importing](../bank/transactions.html), or
[synchronizing](../bank/bank_synchronization.html) your Transactions lines.
Fill in the Ending balance and click on the Reconcile button.

outstanding payment account - then click Validate.
