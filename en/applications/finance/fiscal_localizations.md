# Fiscal localizations

## Fiscal localization packages

**Fiscal Localization Packages** are country-specific modules that install
pre-configured taxes, fiscal positions, chart of accounts, and legal
statements on your database. Some additional features, such as the
configuration of specific certificates, are also added to your Accounting app,
following your fiscal administration requirements.

Note

Odoo continuously adds new localizations and improves the existing packages.

### Configuration

Odoo automatically installs the appropriate package for your company,
according to the country selected at the creation of the database.

Important

As long as you haven’t posted any entry, you can still add and select another
package.

To install a new package, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Fiscal
Localization, click on **Install More Packages** , and install your country’s
module.

### Use

These packages require you to fine-tune your chart of accounts according to
your needs, activate the taxes you use, and configure your country-specific
statements and certifications.
