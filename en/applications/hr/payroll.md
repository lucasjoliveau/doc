# Payroll

Odoo _Payroll_ is used to process work entries and create payslips for
employees, including both regular pay and commission. Payroll works in
conjunction with other Odoo apps, such as _Employees_ , _Timesheets_ , _Time
Off_ , and _Attendances_.

The _Payroll_ app helps ensure there are no issues or conflicts when
validating work entries, handles country-specific localizations to ensure that
payslips follow local rules and taxes, and allows for salary assignments.
Payroll configuration is critical to ensure accurate and timely processing of
payslips.

## Settings

To access the _Settings_ , go to Payroll ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings. Whether
or not payslips are posted in accounting, and whether SEPA payments are
created, is selected here.

The Settings screen is where localization settings are configured.
_Localizations_ are country-specific settings pre-configured in Odoo at the
creation of the database, and account for all taxes, fees, and allowances for
that particular country. The Localization section of the Settings includes a
detailed view of all benefits provided to employees.

![Settings available for Payroll.](../../_images/payroll-settings.png)

Any country-specific localizations are set up in the Localization section of
the Settings screen. All localization items are pre-populated when the country
is specified during the creation of the database. It is not recommended to
alter the localization settings unless specifically required.

Note

Odoo can handle a multi-company configuration. This is generally done when
there is a main company or office location, such as a headquarters, and there
are other offices/branches around the country or globe, that fall under that
main company or headquarters. In Odoo, each company, including the
headquarters, would be setup as their own company/branch using the multi-
company method.

Each individual company can have a different localization setting configured
for that specific company, since company locations can vary and be located
anywhere in the world, where rules and laws differ. For more information on
companies refer to [this documentation](../general/companies.html) on setting
up companies.

## Work entries

A _work entry_ is an individual record on an employee’s timesheet. Work
entries can be configured to account for all types of work and time off, such
as Attendance, Sick Time Off, Training, or Public Holiday.

### Work entry types

When creating a work entry in the _Payroll_ application, or when an employee
enters information in the _Timesheets_ application, a Work Entry Type needs to
be selected. The list of Work Entry Types is automatically created based on
localization settings set in the database.

To view the current work entry types available, go to Payroll ‣ Configuration
‣ Work Entries ‣ Work Entry Types.

Each work entry type has a code to aid in the creation of payslips, and to
ensure all taxes and fees are correctly entered.

![List of all work entry types currently available for use, with the payroll
code and color.](../../_images/work-entry-types.png)

#### New work entry type

To create a new Work Entry Type, click the New button, and enter the
information for the following sections on the form.

##### General information section

  * Work Entry Type Name: The name should be short and descriptive, such as `Sick Time` or `Public Holiday`.

  * Payroll Code: This code appears with the work entry type on timesheets and payslips. Since the code is used in conjunction with the _Accounting_ application, it is advised to check with the accounting department for a code to use.

  * DMFA code: This code is used to identify DMFA entries on a corresponding DMFA report. The DMFA report is a quarterly report that Belgian-based companies are required to submit for social security reporting purposes. This report states the work done by the employees during the quarter, as well as the salaries paid to those employees.

  * External Code: This code is used for exporting data to a third-party payroll service. Check with the third-party being used in order to determine the External Code to enter for the new work entry type.

  * SDWorx code: This code is only for companies that use SDWorx, a payroll service provider.

  * Color: Select a color for the particular work entry type.

##### Display in payslip section

  * Rounding: The rounding method selected determines how quantities on timesheet entries are displayed on the payslip.

    * No Rounding: A timesheet entry is not modified.

    * Half Day: A timesheet entry is rounded to the closest half day amount.

    * Day: A timesheet entry is rounded to the closest full day amount.

Example

If the working time is set to an 8-hour work day (40-hour work week), and an
employee enters a time of 5.5 hours on a timesheet, and Rounding is set to No
Rounding, the entry remains 5.5 hours. If Rounding is set to Half Day, the
entry is changed to 4 hours. If it is set to Day, it is changed to 8 hours.

##### Unpaid section

  * Unpaid in Structures Types: If the work entry is for work that is not paid, specify which pay structure the unpaid work entry applies to from the drop-down menu. Some situations where work would be logged on a timesheet but no compensation given would be for unpaid internships, unpaid training, or volunteer work.

##### Valid for advantages section

  * Meal Voucher: If the work entry should count towards a meal voucher, check the box.

  * Representation Fees: If the work entry should count towards representation fees, check the box.

  * Private Car Reimbursement: If the work entry should count towards a private car reimbursement, check the box.

##### Time off options section

  * Time Off: Check this box if the work entry type can be selected for a time off request or entry in the _Time Off_ application. If Time Off is checked, a Time Off Type field appears. This field has a drop-down menu to select the specific type of time off, such as `Paid Time Off`, `Sick Time Off`, or `Extra Hours` for example. A new type of time off can be entered in the field if the listed types of time off in the drop-down menu do not display the type of time off needed.

  * Keep Time Off Right: This is for Belgian-specific companies only, and will not appear for other localizations. Check this box if the work entry is for time off that will affect the time off benefits for the following year. Workers are given time off each year according to the government, and in some cases, time-off taken during a specific time period can affect how much time off the employee will receive or accrue the following year.

##### Reporting section

  * Unforeseen Absence: If the work entry should be visible on the unforeseen absences report, check this box.

![New work entry type form with all fields to be filled
in.](../../_images/new-work-entry.png)

### Working schedules

To view the currently configured working schedules, go to Payroll ‣
Configuration ‣ Work Entries ‣ Working Schedules. The working schedules that
are available for an employee’s contracts and work entries are found in this
list.

Working schedules are company-specific. Each company must identify each type
of working schedule they use.

Example

An Odoo database containing multiple companies that use a standard 40-hour
work week needs to have a separate working schedule entry for each company
that uses the 40-hour standard work week.

A database with five companies that all use a standard 40-hour work week needs
to have five separate 40-hour working schedules configured.

![All working schedules available to use currently set up in the database for
the company.](../../_images/working-schedules.png)

#### New working schedule

To create a new working schedule, click the New button, and enter the
information on the form.

The fields are auto-populated for a regular 40-hour work week but can be
modified. First, change the name of the working time by modifying the text in
the Name field. Next, make any adjustments to the days and times that apply to
the new working time.

In the Working Hours tab, modify the Day of Week, Day Period, and Work Entry
Type selections by clicking on the drop-down menus in each column and making
the desired selection. The Work From and Work To columns are modified by
typing in the time.

Note

The Work From and Work To times must be in a 24-hour format. For example,
`2:00 PM` would be entered as `14:00`.

If the working time should be in a two-week configuration, click the Switch to
2 weeks calendar button in the top left. This creates entries for an Even week
and an Odd week.

![New working schedule form.](../../_images/new-working-schedule.png)

## Salary

### Structure types

In Odoo, an employee’s payslip is based on _structures_ and _structure types_
, which both affect how an employee enters timesheets. Each structure type is
an individual set of rules for processing a timesheet entry, which consists of
different structures nested within it. Structure types define how often an
employee gets paid, the working hours, and if wages are based on a salary
(fixed) or how many hours the employee worked (varied).

For example, a structure type could be `Employee`, and that structure type
could have two different structures in it: a `Regular Pay` structure which
includes all the separate rules for processing regular pay, as well as a
structure for an `End of Year Bonus` which includes the rules only for the end
of year bonus. Both the `Regular Pay` structure and `End of Year Bonus`
structure are structures within the `Employee` structure type.

The different structure types can be seen by going to Payroll ‣ Configuration
‣ Salary ‣ Structure Types.

There are two default structure types configured in Odoo: _Employee_ and
_Worker_. Typically, _Employee_ is used for salaried employees, which is why
the wage type is _Monthly Fixed Wage_ , and _Worker_ is typically used for
employees paid by the hour, so the wage type is _Hourly Wage_.

![List of all currently configured structure types available to
use.](../../_images/structure-type.png)

### New structure type

To make a new structure type, click the New button and a structure type form
appears. Enter the information in the fields. Most fields are pre-populated,
but all the fields can be modified.

  * Structure Type: Enter the name for the new structure type, such as ‘Employee’ or ‘Worker’.

  * Country: Select the country that the new structure type applies to from the drop-down menu.

  * Wage Type: Select what type of wage the new structure type will use, either Monthly Fixed Wage or Hourly Wage. If the wage type is going to be used for salaried employees who receive the same wage every pay period, select Monthly Fixed Wage. If the wage type is going to be used for employees who receive wages based on how many hours they worked during a pay period, select Hourly Wage.

  * Default Scheduled Pay: Select the typical pay schedule for the new structure type from the drop-down menu. Options are Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-annually, Annually, Weekly, Bi-weekly, Bi-monthly. This indicates how often this type of structure type is paid out.

  * Default Working Hours: Select the default working hours for the new structure type from the drop-down menu. All available working hours for the currently selected company appear in the drop-down menu. The default working hours that are pre-configured in Odoo is the Standard 40 hours/week option. If the needed working hours do not appear in the list, a new set of default working hours can be created.

  * Regular Pay Structure: Type in the name for the regular pay structure.

  * Default Work Entry Type: Select the default type of work entry the new structure type will fall under from the drop-down menu. Options include Attendance, Overtime Hours, Generic Time Off, Compensatory Time Off, Home Working, Unpaid, Sick Time Off, Paid Time Off, and Out Of Contract.

![New structure type form to fill out when creating a new structure
type.](../../_images/new-structure.png)

#### New default working hours

To make new default working hours, type the name for the new working hours in
the Default Working Hours field on the new structure type form. Click Create
and edit. A default working hours form will pop up. The default working hours
form has two sections, a general information section and a tab listing out all
the individual working hours by day and time. When the form is filled out,
click Save & Close.

  * Name: Type in the name for the new default working hours. This should be descriptive and clear to understand, such as `Standard 20 Hours/Week`.

  * Company: Select the company that can use these new default working hours from the drop-down menu. Keep in mind, working hours are company-specific and cannot be shard between companies. Each company needs to have their own working hours set.

  * Average Hour Per Day: The average hours per day field will be auto-populated based on the working hours configured in the _Working Hours_ tab. This entry affects resource planning, since the average daily hours affect what resources can be used, and in what quantity, per work day.

  * Timezone: Select the timezone that the new default working hours will be used for from the drop-down menu.

  * Company Full Time: Enter the number of hours per week an employee would need to work in order to be considered a full-time employee. Typically, this is approximately 40 hours, and this number affects what types of benefits an employee can receive based on their employment status (full-time vs part-time).

  * Work Time rate: This percentage is auto-generated based on the entry for the Company Full Time and the working hours configured in the _Working Hours_ tab. This number should be between `0.00%` and `100%`, so if the percentage is above `100%`, it is an indication that the working times and/or Company Full Time hours need adjustment.

  * Working Hours Tab: This tab is where each day’s specific working hours are listed. When a new default working hour form is created, the working hours tab is pre-populated with a default 40-hour week, with each day divided into three timed sections. Every day has morning (8:00-12:00), lunch (12:00-13:00), and evening (13:00-17:00) hours configured using a 24 hour time format. To adjust any of these hours, click on the specific field to adjust, and make the adjustment using the drop-down menus, or in the specific case of the times, type in the desired time.

Note

If the working hours are not consistent each week, and the hours are on a bi-
weekly schedule instead, click the Switch to 2 week calendar button at the top
of the new default working hours form. This will change the working hours tab
to display two weeks of working times that can be adjusted.

### Structures

_Salary structures_ are the different ways an employee gets paid within a
specific _structure_ , and are specifically defined by various rules.

The amount of structures a company needs for each structure type depends on
how many different ways employees are paid, and how their pay is calculated.
For example, a common structure that could be useful to add may be a `Bonus`.

To view all the various structures for each structure type, go to Payroll ‣
Configuration ‣ Salary ‣ Structures.

Each structure type lists the various structures associated with it. Each
structure contains a set of rules that define it.

![All available salary structures.](../../_images/salary-structure.png)

Click on a structure to view its Salary Rules. These rules are what calculate
the payslip for the employee.

![Salary structure details for Regular Pay, listing all the specific Salary
Rules.](../../_images/structure-regular-pay-rules.png)

### Rules

Each structure has a set of _salary rules_ to follow for accounting purposes.
These rules are configured by the localization, and affect actions in the
_Accounting_ application, so modifications to the default rules, or the
creation of new rules, should only be done when necessary.

To view all the rules, go to Payroll app ‣ Configuration ‣ Salary ‣ Rules.
Click on a structure (such as Regular Pay) to view all the rules.

To make a new rule, click New. A new rule form appears. Enter the information
in the fields.

The required fields for a rule are:

  * Name: Enter a name for the rule.

  * Category: Select a category the rule applies to from the drop-down menu, or enter a new one.

  * Code: Enter a code to be used for this new rule. It is recommended to coordinate with the accounting department for a code to use as this will affect accounting reports and payroll processing.

  * Salary Structure: Select a salary structure the rule applies to from the drop-down menu, or enter a new one.

  * Condition Based on: In the General tab, select from the drop-down menu whether the rule is Always True (always applies), a Range (applies to a specific range, which is entered beneath the selection), or a Python Expression (the code is entered beneath the selection).

  * Amount Type: In the General tab, select from the drop-down menu whether the amount is a Fixed Amount, a Percentage (%), or a Python Code. Depending on what is selected, the fixed amount, percentage, or Python code needs to be entered next.

![Enter the information for the new rule on the new rule
form.](../../_images/new-rule1.png)

### Rule parameters

Note

Currently, the Rule Parameters feature found inside the Payroll app ‣
Configuration ‣ Salary ‣ Rule Parameters menu is still in development and only
serves a specific use case for Belgian markets. The documentation will be
updated when this section has matured to more markets.

### Other input types

When creating payslips, it is sometimes necessary to add other entries for
specific circumstances, like expenses, reimbursements, or deductions. These
other inputs can be configured by going to Payroll ‣ Configuration ‣ Salary ‣
Other Input Types.

![A list of other input types for payroll that can be selected when creating a
new entry for a payslip.](../../_images/other-input.png)

To create a new input type, click the New button. Enter the Description, the
Code, and which structure it applies to in the Availability in Structure
field.

Important

The Code is used in the salary rules to compute payslips. If the Availability
in Structure field is left blank, it indicates that the new input type is
available for all payslips and is not exclusive to a specific structure.

![Create a new Input Type.](../../_images/input-type-new.png)

## Salary package configurator

The various options under the Salary Package Configurator section of the
Payroll ‣ Configuration ‣ Salary Package Configurator menu all affect an
employee’s potential salary. These sections (Advantages, Personal Info,
Resume, and Offers) specify what benefits can be offered to an employee in
their salary package.

Depending on what information an employee enters (such as deductions,
dependents, etc.), their salary is adjusted accordingly. When an applicant
applies for a job on the company website, the sections under Salary Package
Configurator directly affect what the applicant sees, and what is populated as
the applicant enters information.

### Advantages

When offering potential employees a position, there can be certain
_advantages_ or benefits set in Odoo in addition to the salary to make an
offer more appealing (such as extra time off, the use of a company car,
reimbursement for a phone or internet, etc.).

To see the advantages, go to Payroll ‣ Configuration ‣ Salary Package
Configurator ‣ Advantages. Advantages are grouped by Structure type, and the
advantage listed for a particular structure type is only available for that
specific structure.

![A list view of all the advantages or benefits that is available for each
structure type.](../../_images/advantages.png)

Example

A company has two structure types, one labeled Employee, and anther labeled
Intern. The Employee structure type contains an advantage of using a company
car, while the Intern structure type does not. Instead, the Intern structure
type has a meal voucher advantage available, while the Employee structure type
does not.

A person hired under the Employee structure type can use a company car, but
cannot have meal vouchers. The opposite is true for someone hired under the
Intern structure type. They would have meal vouchers available to them, not
the use of a company car.

To make a new advantage, click the New button, and enter the information in
the fields. The required fields for an advantage are:

  * Name: Enter the name for the advantage.

  * Advantage Field: Select from the drop-down menu what field in the payslip this advantage appears under.

  * Advantage Type: Select from the drop-down menu what type of advantage the benefit is. Select from Monthly Benefit in Kind, Monthly Advantages in Net, Monthly Advantages in Cash, or Yearly Advantages in Cash.

  * Salary Structure Type: Select from the drop-down menu which salary structure type this advantage applies to.

  * Display Type: Select from the drop-down menu how this advantage is displayed.

![List of advantages employee's can have.](../../_images/new-advantage.png)

### Personal info

Every employee in Odoo has an _employee card_ which is created when a
candidate becomes an employee. This card includes all of their personal
information, resume, work information, and documents.

The personal information is gathered from the salary package configurator
section that a candidate fills out after being offered a position. This
personal information is then transferred to the employee card when they are
hired.

To view an employee’s card, go to the main Employees app dashboard, and click
on the employee’s card.

Note

An employee card can be thought of as an employee personnel file.

The _Personal Information_ section lists all of the fields that are available
to enter on the employee’s card. To access this section, go to Payroll ‣
Configuration ‣ Salary Package Configurator ‣ Personal Info.

![A list of all the personal information that appears on employee card to
enter.](../../_images/personal-info.png)

To edit a personal info entry, select the entry from the list, and modify the
personal info. To create a new personal info entry, click the New button.

The required fields, aside from entering the Information name, are Related
Model, Related Field, and Category. Select a Related Model from the drop-down
menu. Employee populates the field by default, but the Bank Account option is
also available if the information is related to a bank account instead. Select
a Related Field from the drop-down menu that best describes what kind of
personal information this entry is, and where it is going to be stored in the
backed. Then, select a Category from the drop-down menu that the personal
information should be under, such as Address or Personal Documents.

The two most important fields on the personal info form are Is Required and
Display Type. Checking the Is Required box makes the field mandatory on the
employee’s card. The Display Type drop-down menu allows for the information to
be entered in a variety of ways, from a Text box, to a customizable Radio
button, a Checkbox, a Document, and more.

![New personal information entry.](../../_images/personal-new.png)

### Resume

Note

Currently, the Resume feature found inside the Payroll app ‣ Configuration ‣
Salary Package Configurator ‣ Resume menu is still in development and only
serves a specific use case for Belgian markets. The documentation will be
updated when this section has matured to more markets.

### Offers

When a candidate is offered a position, there are several items that need to
be tracked in order for a business to stay organized, such as where in the
offer process the candidate is, how long the offer is valid for, as well as
all the offer details. These details are all stored in each _offers_ record.

To view all offers, go to Payroll ‣ Configuration ‣ Salary Package
Configurator ‣ Offers. All offers that have been sent to either potential
candidates or current employees appears in this list. The status, offer start
date and expiration date, amount of the contract, and more, can all be found
in this list. Offers sent via the Recruitment application appear here, but
there is an option to create a new offer from the Payroll application as well.

![A list of all offers given to a current employee or potential candidate
along with the status of the offer.](../../_images/offers.png)

To create a new offer, click the New button. The two required fields are the
Contract Template, and the Company. Select the Contract Template and Company
from the drop-down menus. Fill in any other details for the offer, such as the
Job Title, Department, the Contract Start Date and the Offer Validity Date.
