# Create a new employee

When a new employee is hired, the first step is to create a new employee
record. Starting in the Employees app dashboard, click the New button and a
new employee form appears. Fill out the required information and any
additional details.

![Create a new employee form with all fields filled
out.](../../../_images/new-employee-form.png)

Note

The current company phone number and name is populated in the Work Phone and
Company fields.

## General information

The employee form automatically saves as data is entered, but the save
manually icon (a could with an up arrow inside it) may be clicked at any time
to manually save the form.

### Required fields

  * Name: Enter the employee‚Äôs name.

  * Company: Select the company from the drop-down menu that the new employee is hired by, or create a new company by typing the name in the field.

![A new employee form with the required fields
highlighted.](../../../_images/employee-new.png)

### Optional fields

  * Photo: In the top right image box of the employee form, click on the ‚úèÔ∏è (pencil) edit icon to select a photo to upload.

  * Job Position: Enter the employee‚Äôs job position title under their name, or select the job position from the Job Position drop-down menu to have this field auto-populate. The Job Position field under the employee name can be modified and does not need to match the selection made in the Job Position drop-down.

Example

It is recommended to have the job positions match, but if desired, the typed-
in description in this field can contain more information than the selected
drop-down job position.

An example where this may be applicable is if someone is hired for a sales
representative position configured as Sales Representative in the
_Recruitment_ app, and that is selected for the drop-down Job Position field.

In the typed in job position field beneath the employee‚Äôs name, the position
could be more specific, such as `Sales Representative - Subscriptions` if the
employee is focused solely on subscription sales.

![Both job position fields entered but with different
information.](../../../_images/job-description-fields.png)

  * Tags: Click on a tag in the drop-down menu to add any tags applicable to the employee. Any tag can be created in this field by typing it in. Once created, the new tag is available for all employee records. There is no limit to the amount of tags that can be added.

  * Work Contact Information: Enter the employee‚Äôs Work Mobile, Work Phone, Work Email, and/or Company name.

  * Department: Select the employee‚Äôs department from the drop-down menu.

  * Job Position: Select the employee‚Äôs job position from the drop-down menu. Once a selection is made, the Job Position field beneath the employee‚Äôs name automatically updates to reflect the currently selected job position. These positions are from the [Recruitment](../recruitment/new_job.html) application, and reflect the currently configured job positions.

  * Manager: Select the employee‚Äôs manager from the drop-down menu.

  * Coach: Select the employee‚Äôs coach from the drop-down menu.

  * Next Appraisal Date: This date automatically populates with a date that is computed according to the settings configured in the _Appraisals_ application. This date can be modified using the calendar selector.

Note

After a Manager is selected, if the Coach field is blank, the selected manager
automatically populates the Coach field.

Tip

To make edits to the selected Department, Manager, Coach, or Company, click
the Internal Link arrow next to the respective selection. The Internal Link
arrow opens the selected form, allowing for modifications. Click Save after
any edits are made.

### Work Information tab

The Work Information tab is where the employee‚Äôs specific job related
information is housed. Their working schedule, various roles, who approves
their specific requests (time off, timesheets, and expenses), and specific
work location details are listed here. Click on the Work Information tab to
access this section, and enter the following information for the new employee.

  * Location: Select the Work Address from the drop-down menu. To modify the address, hover over the first line (if there are multiple lines) of the address to reveal an Internal Link arrow. Click the Internal Link arrow to open up the company form, and make any edits. Use the breadcrumb menu to navigate back to the new employee form when done. If a new work address is needed, add the address by typing it in the field, then click Create (new address) to add the address, or Create and edit‚Ä¶ to add the new address and edit the address form.

  * Approvers: In order to see this section, the user must have either Administrator or Officer: Manage all employees rights set for the Employees application. Using the drop-down menus, select the users responsible for approving Expenses, Time Off, and Timesheets for the employee. Hover over any of the selections to reveal the Internal Link arrow. Click the Internal Link arrow to open a form with the approver‚Äôs Name, Email Address, Company, Phone, Mobile, and Default Warehouse fields. These can be modified, if needed. Use the breadcrumb menu to navigate back to the new employee form when done.

After edits are done, click Save & Close, and the new location is added, and populates the field. For days the employee does not work, for example, Saturday and Sunday, leave the field blank (Unspecified).

Note

It is also possible to add or modify work locations by navigating to Employees
app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Employee: Work Locations. Click New to create a new
location, then enter the details on the form. To modify a location, click on
an existing location, then make any changes on the form.

  * Schedule: Select the Working Hours and Timezone for the employee. The Internal Link arrow opens up a detailed view of the specific daily working hours. Working hours can be modified or deleted here.

Note

Working hours can also be modified in the _Payroll_ application, where they
are referred to as Working Schedules. For more information on how to create or
modify Working Schedules in Payroll, refer to the [Payroll](../payroll.html)
documentation.

  * Planning: Click on a role from the drop-down menu for both the Roles and the Default Role fields to add a role. There is no limit to the amount of Roles that can be selected for an employee, but there can only be one Default Role. The default role is the _typical_ role that the employee performs, where the Roles are _all_ the specific roles the employee is able to perform. The Default Role must be selected as a Role, if not, when the Default Role is selected, that role is automatically added to the list of Roles.

Tip

The Planning section affects the _Planning_ app, and will only appear if the
_Planning_ app is installed. When planning work in the _Planning_ app,
employees can only be scheduled for specific work that corresponds to their
selected roles. For example, only an employee with a _Functional Tester_ role
can be assigned to perform any activity that requires a _Functional Tester_.

Important

The users that appear in the drop-down menu for the Approvers section must
have _Administrator_ rights set for the corresponding human resources role. To
check who has these rights, go to Settings app ‚Ä£ Users ‚Ä£ ‚Üí Manage Users. Click
on an employee, and check the Human Resources section of the Access Rights
tab.

  * In order for the user to appear as an approver for Expenses, they must have either Team Approver, All Approver, or Administrator set for the Expenses role.

  * In order for the user to appear as an approver for Time Off, they must have either Officer or Administrator set for the Time Off role.

  * In order for the user to appear as an approver for Timesheets, they must have either Manager, Officer, or Administrator set for the Payroll role.

Note

Working Hours are related to a company‚Äôs working times, and an employee cannot
have working hours that are outside of a company‚Äôs working times.

Each individual working time is company-specific, so for multi-company
databases, each company needs to have its own working hours set.

If an employee‚Äôs working hours are not configured as a working time for the
company, new working times can be added, or existing working times can be
modified. To add or modify a working time, go to the Payroll app ‚Ä£
Configuration ‚Ä£ Working Times, and add a new working time or edit an existing
one.

After the new working time is created, or an existing one is modified, select
the employee‚Äôs working hours using the drop-down menu in the Schedule section
of the Work Information tab.

### Private Information tab

No information in the Private Information tab is required to create an
employee, however, some information in this section may be critical for the
company‚Äôs payroll department. In order to properly process payslips and ensure

be entered.

Emergency contact, and Citizenship information is entered. Fields are entered

Next, click on the month. Last, click on the day to select the date. Type in the information for the Identification No (identification number, Passport No (passport number), and Place of Birth fields. Last, if the employee is not a resident of the country they are working in, activate the check box next to the Non-resident field.

country the company is located. Different fields are configured for different
locations, however some sections appear regardless.

  * Status: Select an Employee Type and, if applicable, a Related User, with the drop-down menus. The Employee Type options include Employee, Student, Trainee, Contractor, or Freelancer.
