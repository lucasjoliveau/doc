Example</p><p>It is recommended to have the job positions match, but if desired, the typed-in description in
this field can contain more information than the selected drop-down job position.</p>
<p>An example where this may be applicable is if someone is hired for a sales representative
position configured as <b>Sales Representative</b> in the <em>Recruitment</em> app, and that is
selected for the drop-down <b>Job Position</b> field.</p>
<p>In the typed in job position field beneath the employee‚Äôs name, the position could be more
specific, such as <code>Sales Representative - Subscriptions</code> if the employee is focused solely on
subscription sales.</p>
