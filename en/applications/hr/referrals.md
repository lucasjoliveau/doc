# Referrals

Odoo’s _Referrals_ application is a centralized place where all information
regarding referrals is housed, from points earned, coworkers hired, and
rewards selected. Users can recommend people they know for job positions, then
earn referral points as those people progress through the recruitment
pipeline. Once enough referral points are earned, they can be exchanged for
prizes. The Referrals application integrates with the _Employees_ ,
_Recruitment_ , and _Website_ applications, all of which must be installed in
order for the _Referrals_ application to function.

The only configuration needed for the Referrals application after it is
installed are the rewards; everything else is pre-configured when Odoo
Referrals is installed.

Any user with either Referral User, Officer, or Administrator rights for the
Recruitment application has access to the Referrals application. Only user’s
with Administrator rights for the Recruitment application have access to the
reporting and configurations menus. For more information on users and access
rights, refer to these documents: [Users](../general/users.html) and [Access
rights](../general/users/access_rights.html).

## Onboarding

When opening the _Referrals_ application for the first time, a pre-configured
onboarding script appears. This is in the form of four slides, each explaining
the different parts of the Referrals application. At the top of the dashboard,
the following message is displayed throughout all the onboarding slides:
GATHER YOUR TEAM! Job Referral Program. Behind this main message is an image,
and beneath it some more explanatory text.

Each of the onboarding slides has a corresponding image and message that is
displayed. After reading each message, click the Next button to advance to the
next slide.

The text that appears on each slide is as follows:

  1. Oh no! Villains are lurking the city! Help us recruit a team of superheroes to save the day!

  2. Browse through open job positions, promote them on social media, or refer friends.

  3. Collect points and exchange them for awesome gifts in the shop.

  4. Compete against your colleagues to build the best justice league!

Note

The onboarding slides will appear every time the Referrals application is
opened, until all the slides have been viewed and the Start Now button has
been clicked. If the onboarding is exited at any point, or if the Start Now
button has _not_ been clicked, the onboarding slides will begin again when the
Referrals application is opened. Once the Start Now button has been clicked,
the onboarding slides will not be seen again, and the main dashboard will load
when the Referrals application is opened from that point on.

At any point during onboarding, the Skip button may be clicked. This exits the
onboarding, and the main Referrals dashboard loads. If Skip is clicked,
onboarding slides will not load anymore when opening the Referrals
application.

![An onboarding slide with the skip and next buttons visible at the
bottom.](../../_images/onboarding.png)

Note

If there are any candidates hired that the user had referred prior to opening
the Referrals app (meaning the onboarding slides have not appeared before),
when Start Now is clicked at the end of onboarding, instead of going to the
main dashboard, a hired screen appears instead.

### Modifying onboarding slides

Onboarding slides can be modified if desired. Only users with Administrator
rights for the Recruitment application can modify onboarding slides. To edit a
slide, navigate to Referrals app ‣ Configuration ‣ Onboarding. Each line
displays the text for the individual onboarding slide. To edit an onboarding
slide, click on an individual slide line to open the slide’s onboarding form,
then click Edit.

Make any changes to the message in the Text box. To change the order the slide
appear in the onboarding, the Sequence can be modified. Type in the
corresponding number to indicate the order in which the slides should be
displayed. A Company may be selected, however, if this field is populated,
that slide will only be displayed for that particular company.

The image can be modified as well. Hover over the image thumbnail in the top
right corner of the form. A ✏️ (pencil) icon and 🗑️ (garbage can) icon appear.
Click the ✏️ (pencil) icon to change the image. A file navigator window loads.
Navigate to the desired image, select it, then click Open. The new image
appears in the thumbnail. To delete an image, click the 🗑️ (garbage can) icon,
then select a new image using the ✏️ (pencil) icon.

To save any changes, click Save, or click Discard to delete any changes and
revert to the original content.

![An onboarding slide in edit mode, with the main fields
highlighted.](../../_images/edit-onboarding.png)

The order of the slides can also be changed directly in the Onboarding
dashboard, without having to edit an individual onboarding slide. Click the up
and down arrow symbol that appears after the checkbox and before the slide
text, and drag the slide to the desired position. The Sequence automatically
changes on all the slide’s onboarding forms, reflecting the new sequence.

![The onboarding slides in a list, with the drag and drop arrows
highlighted.](../../_images/onboarding-reorder.png)

## Hired referrals

When a candidate that has been referred by a user is hired, the user “grows
their superhero team” and adds superhero avatars to their Referrals dashboard.

After a referral has been hired, when the user next opens the Referrals app,
instead of the main dashboard, a hired page loads. The text (Referral Name)
has been hired! Choose an avatar for your new friend! appears.

Below this message are five avatar thumbnails to choose from. If an avatar has
already been assigned to a referral, the thumbnail is greyed out, and the name
the avatar has been chosen for appears beneath the avatar. Click on an
available avatar to select it.

If more than one referral was hired since opening the Referrals application,
after selecting the first avatar, the user is prompted to select another
avatar for the subsequent hired referral. Once all avatars have been selected,
the dashboard loads and all the avatars are now visible. Mouse over each
avatar and their name is displayed above them.

![The hired screen. A selection of avatars are presented to chose from, with
any already chosen are greyed out.](../../_images/avatars.png)

### Modify friends

Friend avatars are able to be modified in the same manner that levels are
modified. Only users with Administrator rights for the Recruitment application
can make modifications to friends. The pre-configured friends can be seen and
modified by navigating to Referrals app ‣ Configuration ‣ Friends. Each friend
avatar appears in the Dashboard Image column, and the corresponding name
appears in the Friend Name column. The default images are a motley group of
hero characters, ranging from robots to dogs.

To modify a friend’s dashboard image, thumbnail, name, or position, click on
an individual friend to open the referral friend form. Click Edit to make
modifications. Type the name in the Friend Name field. The name is solely to
differentiate the friends in the configuration menu; the friend’s name is not
visible anywhere else in the Referrals application.

The Position can be set to either Front or Back. This determines the position
of the friend in relation to the user’s super hero avatar. Click the radio
button next to the desired selection, and the friend will appear either in
front of or behind the user’s avatar when activated.

If desired, both the thumbnail Image and the Dashboard Image can be modified.
Hover over the image being replaced to reveal a ✏️ (pencil) icon and 🗑️
(garbage can) icon. Click the ✏️ (pencil) icon and a file explorer window
appears. Navigate to the desired image file then click Open to select it.

Once all changes have been made, click the Save button to save the changes, or
click the Discard button to revert to the original information.

![A friend form in edit mode.](../../_images/edit-friend.png)

Warning

It is not advised to edit the images. An image file must have a transparent
background in order for it to render properly. Only users with knowledge about
transparent images should attempt adjusting any images in the Referrals
application.

Once an image is changed and the friend is saved, it is **not possible** to
revert to the original image. To revert to the original image, the Referrals
application must be _uninstalled then reinstalled._

## Referral points

The referral program is based on earning points that are then exchanged for
rewards. On the main Referrals application dashboard, the top displays a
summary of the user’s current points. The left side of the summary displays
the total points earned, and the right side displays the points that are
available to spend.

To see the various referrals and the points earned for each, click on one of
the buttons directly beneath the avatars. The options are Referrals, Ongoing,
and Successful.

The current number of referrals who are still active in the recruitment
pipeline, and have not yet been hired or refused, appear above the Ongoing
button. The number of referrals who have been hired appear above the
Successful button. The total number of referrals (both the ongoing and
successful referrals combined) appear above the Referrals button.

Note

To view the referrals associated with each of the categories, Referrals,
Ongoing, and Successful, click on the corresponding button. All the referrals
for that specific category are displayed.

### My referrals

To see all the referrals (both ongoing and successful) click the Referrals
button. A My Referral window loads. This screen displays all the referrals,
with each referral in its own referral card.

A successful referral has a green line down the left side of the card, and
displays a ✓ Hired image in the top right corner of the card. Referrals that
are in process display an In Progress image in the top right corner.

Each referral card lists the name of the applicant, the department the job
position is in, the name of the job position, the person responsible for
filling the role (recruiter), and the points earned.

#### Points

The points that can be earned for a referral are the same across all job
positions. Each stage of the recruitment process has corresponding points
assigned to it. The stages listed correspond to the stages configured in the
_Recruitment_ application.

On each individual referral card, beneath the points earned is a bar chart
that displays how many points have been earned out of the total possible
points that can be earned if the applicant is hired.

Beneath the bar chart is a list of the various recruitment stages and the
points earned when the referral moves to that stage. If a stage has been
achieved and the points have been earned, a green check mark appears next to
the stage.

Example

The pre-configured point structure for referrals is as follows:

  * Initial Qualification: 1 point

  * First Interview: 20 points

  * Second Interview: 9 points

  * Contract Proposal: 5 points

  * Contract Signed: 50 points

The total points earned for a referral that is hired is 85 points.
Modifications of the points earned for each stage is done in the Recruitment
application. Refer to the [Recruitment](recruitment.html#recruitment-modify-
stages) documentation to modify the points for each stage.

## Rewards

### Create rewards

The rewards are the only configurations needed when setting up the Referrals
application. Only users with Administrator rights for the Recruitment
application can create or modify rewards. To add rewards, navigate to
Referrals app ‣ Configuration ‣ Rewards. Click Create and a reward form loads.
Enter the following information on the form:

  * Product Name: Enter the name as it should appear for the reward.

  * Cost: Enter the amount of points required to redeem the reward.

  * Company: Using the drop-down menu, select the company the reward will appear for. If a reward is to be used for several companies, each company needs to have a record of the reward, with the company listed on the form.

  * Gift Responsible: Select the person who will be responsible for procuring and delivering the reward to the recipient, using the drop-down menu. This person is alerted when the reward is purchased, so they know when to deliver the reward to the recipient.

  * Description: Type in the description for the reward. This will be visible on the reward card, beneath the title.

  * Photo: Add a photo of the reward, which appears on the rewards page. Hover over the image square, and two icons appear, a ✏️ (pencil) and a 🗑️ (garbage can). Click the ✏️ (pencil) icon and a file explorer appears. Navigate to the photo file, then click Open to select it.

The only required fields are the Product Name, Company, and Description.

![A filled out reward form with all details
entered.](../../_images/rewards.png)

Important

It is advised to enter a Cost and add a Photo. If a cost is not entered, the
default cost will be listed as zero, which would list the reward as free in
the reward shop. If a photo is not selected, a placeholder icon will be
displayed on the rewards page.

### Redeem rewards

To redeem points for a reward, click the Rewards button on the main Referrals
dashboard. All the configured rewards are listed in individual reward cards.
The points required to purchase the reward is listed in the top right corner
of the card. If the user has enough points to purchase a reward, a 🧺 (basket)
Buy button appears at the bottom of the reward card. If they do not have
enough points for a reward, the reward card displays You need another (x)
points to buy this instead of a buy button.

Click the 🧺 (basket) Buy button on a reward to purchase it. A confirmation
pop-up appears, asking if the user is sure they want to purchase the reward.
Click OK to purchase the item, or Cancel to close the window and cancel the
purchase.

After OK is clicked, the pop-up window closes, and the points used to purchase
the reward are subtracted from the user’s available points. The rewards
presented are now updated to reflect the user’s current available points.

![Buy button appears below a mug and backpack reward, while the bicycle reward
states how many more reward points are needed to
redeem.](../../_images/redeem-rewards.png)

## Levels

The referrals application has pre-configured levels that are reflected in the
user’s avatar on the Referrals dashboard. As a user refers potential employees
and earns points, they can _level up_ , much like in a video game.

Levels have no functional impact on the performance of the application. They
are solely used for the purpose of adding achievement tiers for participants
to aim for, gamifying referrals for the user.

The user’s current level is displayed at the top of the main Referrals
application dashboard, directly beneath their photo, in a Level: X format. In
addition, a colored ring appears around the user’s photo, indicating how many
points the user currently has, and how many additional points they need to
level up. The cyan colored portion of the ring represents points earned, while
the white colored portion represents the points still needed before they can
level up.

### Modify levels

Only users with Administrator rights for the Recruitment application can
modify levels. The pre-configured levels can be seen and modified by
navigating to Referrals app ‣ Configuration ‣ Levels. Each avatar appears in
the Image column, and the corresponding level number appears in the Level Name
column. The default images are of Odoo superheroes, and each level adds an
additional element to their avatar, such as capes and shields.

To modify a level’s image, name, or points required to reach the level, click
on an individual level in the list to open the level form. Click Edit to make
modifications.

Type in the name or number of the level in the Level Name field. What is
entered is displayed beneath the user’s photo on the main dashboard when they
reach that level. Enter the number of referral points needed to reach that
level in the Requirements field. The points needed to level up are the total
accumulated points earned over the lifetime of the employee, not additional
points from the previous level that must be earned.

If desired, the Image can also be modified. Hover over the image to reveal a
✏️ (pencil) icon and 🗑️ (garbage can) icon. Click the ✏️ (pencil) icon and a
file explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired image file then click
Open to select it.

Once all changes have been made, click the Save button to save the changes, or
click the Discard button to revert to the original information.

![A level form in edit mode.](../../_images/levels.png)

Warning

It is not advised to edit the images. An image file must have a transparent
background in order for it to render properly. Only users with knowledge about
transparent images should attempt adjusting any images in the Referrals
application.

Once an image is changed and the level is saved, it is **not possible** to
revert to the original image. To revert to the original image, the Referrals
application must be _uninstalled then reinstalled._

### Level up

Once enough points have been accumulated to level up, the circle around the
user’s photo is completely filled in with a cyan color, a large image stating
Level up! appears above the photo, and the phrase Click to level up! appears
beneath the user’s photo and current level.

Click on either the LEVEL UP! graphic, the user’s photo, or the text Click to
level up! beneath the user’s photo to level up the user. The user’s avatar
changes to the current level, and the ring around the photo is updated to
indicate the current amount of points.

Leveling up does not cost the user any points, the user simply needs to earn
the specified amount of points required.

![A 'Click to level up!' appears beneath the user's image, and a large 'Level
up!' appears above their image.](../../_images/level-up.png)

Note

Once a user has reached the highest configured level, they will continue to
accrue points that can be redeemed for rewards, but they are no longer able to
level up. The ring around their photo remains solid cyan.

## Alerts

In the Referrals application, it is possible to post a message, also referred
to as an _alert_ , at the top of the dashboard to share important information
with users. These alerts appear as a thin semi-transparent banner, with the
word New! appearing on the far left. The text for the alert is in the center
of the banner, and on the far right side is an X.

Alerts appear on the main dashboard for the specified time configured on the
individual alert. If a user does not wish to see a specific alert again, click
the X in the far right side of the alert. This removes the alert from the
dashboard and will not appear again, even when opening the Referrals
application for the first time in a new session.

![Two alert banners appear above the user's photo.](../../_images/alerts.png)

### Create an alert

Only users with Administrator rights for the Recruitment application can
create alerts. To add a new alert, navigate to the Referrals application ‣
Configuration ‣ Alerts.

Click Create and a blank alert form loads. Enter the following information on
the form:

  * Date From: The date the alert starts. On this date, the alert will be visible on the dashboard.

  * Date To: The date the alert ends. After this date, the alert will be hidden from view.

  * Company: The current company populates this field by default. To modify the company the alert should be displayed for, select the company from the drop-down menu. If this field remains blank, the alert is visible to everyone with access to the Referrals application. If a company is specified, only user’s within that company (who also have access to the Referrals application) will see the alert.

  * Alert: Enter the text for the alert. This message appears inside the alert banner on the main dashboard.

  * On Click: There are three options for the alert. Click the radio button next to the desired selection. The options are:

    * Not Clickable: The alert only displays text, there is no link to click.

    * Go to All Jobs: The alert contains a link that when clicked, navigates to the website with all the currently posted job positions.

    * Specify URL: The alert contains a link to a specific URL, that when clicked, navigates to that URL. When selected, a URL field appears below the On Click section. Enter the URL in the field.

![An alert form completely filled in with all selections
entered.](../../_images/alert-form.png)

## Reporting

Only users with Administrator rights for the Recruitment application have
access to the Reporting feature in Referrals. To access the reports, click
Referrals application ‣ Reporting. The main view is the Reporting Dashboard
view, which contains three sections.

In the top portion of the window, the report displays a bar chart of how many
referred candidates are hired, and how many are still in the hiring pipeline.
The candidates are further divided by channel, showing specifically where the
referral came from, such as a direct referral, Facebook, etc. If a channel
does not appear on the report, that indicates there are no referrals from that
particular channel.

The middle third provides all the specific data that has been tracked. This
includes how many total points have been earned across all referrals, how many
applicants were referred, hired, or refused, how many applicants the current
logged-in user referred, how many total points were earned, and how many
points were given for refused applicants.

The bottom third displays a pivot table. This table can be inserted into a new
or existing spreadsheet. To do so, click the Insert in Spreadsheet button
right above the chart. A pop-up appears, asking which spreadsheet to insert
the pivot chart into. Select the desired spreadsheet from the drop-down menu,
or select New Spreadsheet. Click Confirm and the selected spreadsheet loads,
with the new table in it.

Note

The spreadsheet is stored in the _Documents_ application. This application
needs to be installed in order to use the Insert in Spreadsheet option.
