# Share job positions

In Konvergo ERP _Referrals_ , users can earn referral points by sharing job positions
with potential applicants. Job positions can be shared in several ways,
through the View Jobs button and the Email A Friend button, located at the
bottom of the _Referrals_ app dashboard.

## View Jobs

To see all job positions that are actively recruiting candidates, click the
**View Jobs** button on the main _Referrals_ dashboard. This presents all job
positions, with each individual job presented with its own card.

information is displayed on the card.](../../../_images/jobs1.png)

Each job position card contains the following information:

  * The title of the job position. This information is taken from the _Job Position_ field of the job form.

  * The number of **Open Positions** being recruited. This information is taken from the _Expected New Employees_ field of the _Recruitment_ tab of the job form.

  * The points a user earns when an applicant applies for the position.

  * The job description detailing the job position. This information is taken from the _Job Position_ tab of the job form.

To see all the details for a job position, click the **More Info** button on
the specific card. This opens the job position webpage in a new browser tab.
This is what an applicant sees before applying for a position.

Note</p><p>Only published job positions are visible in the <em>Referrals</em> app. To check which job positions are
published or not, refer to the <a href="../recruitment/new_job">Job positions</a> documentation.</p>
</div>

## Refer friends

To share a job position with someone, click the **Refer Friend** button on the
specific job position card. A pre-configured **Send Job Offer by Mail** pop-up
window appears. Enter the recipientâ€™s email address in the **Email** field.

The **Subject** and **Body** are populated using a default template. The
**Subject** `Job for you` is present, by default, but can be modified, if
desired.

The specific title of the job position populates the _Job Position_
placeholder in the email body. The `See Job Offer` text in the email body is
an individualized tracking link to the specific job position listed on the
website.

When the prospective employee receives the email, the link sends them to the
job position page, where they can apply for the position, and the person who
referred them is tracked in the _Referrals_ application.

If desired, add any text or closing salutation to the email body. When all
edits have been made, click **Send Mail** to send the email, or click
**Cancel** to close the pop-up window.

## Share a job

Other than sending an email, job positions can be shared, via social media
platforms, and by tracking links to the job position. At the bottom of each
job position card are four icons, and corresponding tracking links, that can
be used to share the job position, keeping track of applicants in the
_Referrals_ application.

job.](../../../_images/share.png)

### Link

To share the job position with a customized tracking link, click the **Share
Now** button with the __**(link)** icon above it. A **Link to Share** pop-up
window appears with the tracking link. Click **Copy** to copy the link. After
the link is copied, click the **Close** button to close the pop-up window.
Next, share the link with the prospective employee.

### Facebook

To share the job position using Facebook, click the **Share Now** button with
the __**(Facebook)** icon above it.

If the user is already logged into Facebook, when the the **Share Now** button
is clicked, a **Share on Facebook** page loads in a new tab, with the link
populated in the main body of the new post in a pop-up window. If the user is
_not_ already logged in, a log-in screen loads, instead, prompting the user to
log-in to Facebook first.

Type in any additional information to add to the post, then share the job
position using the available options in Facebook.

### X (formerly Twitter)

A job position can also be shared on X. Click the **Share Now** button with
the **(X)** icon above it.

If the user is already signed-in to X, when the **Share Now** button is
clicked, an X page loads in a new tab with a pre-populated message ready to
post, in a draft pop-up window. If the user is _not_ already signed-in, a
sign-in screen loads instead, prompting the user to first sign-in to X.

The default message is:

`Amazing job offer for (Job Position)! Check it live: (link to Job Position)`

Type in any additional information, or make any edits to the message, then
share using the available options in X.

### LinkedIn

To share a job position on LinkedIn, click the **Share Now** button with the
__**(LinkedIn)** icon above it.

If the user is already logged into LinkedIn, when the **Share Now** button is
clicked, a new tab loads in LinkedIn, with a link to the job position at the
top. If the user is _not_ already logged in, a log-in screen loads instead,
prompting the user to log-in to LinkedIn first.

The job position can be shared either in a public post, or in a private
message to an individual (or group of individuals).

Type in any additional information, or make any edits to the message or post,
then share using the available options in LinkedIn.

### Email a friend

Another way to share job opportunities is to share the entire current list of
open job positions, instead of one job position at a time. To do this,
navigate to the Referrals main dashboard. Click the **Email a friend** button
at the bottom of the screen. A **Send Job Offer by Mail** pop-up window
appears.

Enter the email address in the **Email** field. The email can be sent to
multiple recipients by separating each email address with a comma followed by
a single space. The **Subject** is pre-configured with **Job for you** , but
can be edited.

The email **Body** is also populated with pre-configured text. The text that
appears is:

`Hello,`

`There are some amazing job offers in my company! Have a look, they can be
interesting for you:`

`See Job Offers`

The **See Job Offers** text is a tracking link to a complete list of all job
positions currently being recruited for. Add any additional text and make any
edits to the message body, if necessary. Then, click **Send Mail** to send the
email. This sends the message, and closes the window.
