# Job positions

In the default Recruitment dashboard view, all job positions are shown,
regardless of status. Current published positions with active applicants are
shown, as well as job positions that have been created but have not yet been
published.

Each job position is shown in an individual kanban card. If the job position
is active and candidates can apply, then a Published banner will appear in the
top-right corner of the card.

View submitted applications by clicking anywhere on a job position card.

button to delete it.

Enter the job description in the Job Summary tab. This information is what is
visible to potential applicants when searching for available jobs.

#### Recruitment

All the basic information about the job position is listed under the
Recruitment tab. None of the fields are required, but it is a good idea to
provide at least a few details, such as where the job is located.

The fields can be filled out as follows:

  * Department: select the relevant department for the job position.

  * Job Location: select the physical address for the job.

  * Employment Type: select what type of position the job is, such as Full-Time, Part-Time, etc.

  * Interview Form: select an Interview form that applicants will fill out prior to their interview.

  * Contract Template: select a contract template that will be used when offering the job to a candidate.

    * Time to Answer: enter the number of days before the applicant is contacted.

    * Process: enter the various stages the candidate will go through during the recruitment process.

exactly as it appears in this tab.

tab.](../../../_images/recruitment-tab.png)

### Create interview form

An _Interview Form_ is used to determine if a candidate is a good fit for a
job position. Interview forms can be as specific or general as desired, and
can take the form of a certification, an exam, or a general questionnaire.
Interview forms are determined by the recruitment team.

All interview forms must be created, there are no pre-configured forms in
Odoo. To create an interview form, start from the recruitment tab of the Job
Position form. In the Interview Form field, enter a name for the new interview
form. As the name is typed, several options populate beneath the entry, Create
(interview form name), View all, and Create and edit…. Click Create and edit….
and a Create Interview Form pop-up window appears.

Note

The option View all only appears if there are any interview forms already
created. If no interview forms exist, the only options available are Create
(interview form name), and Create and edit….

First, enter a name for the form in the Name field. This should be indicative
of when the form should be used. For example, is the form specific to a job
position, or is it a general form that can be used for all recruitment
scenarios?

Next, select what kind of interview form is being created. The default is
Custom, which is pre-selected. The various options are Survey, Live session,
Assessment, Custom, and Appraisal.

Then select the person responsible for the form from the drop-down menu for
the Responsible field.

If desired, an image can be added to the interview form. Mouse over the camera
icon on the far right and a ✏️ (pencil) icon appears. Click the ✏️ (pencil)
icon and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired image file,
then click Open to select it.

selected.](../../../_images/create-interview-form.png)

#### Questions

In the Questions tab, click on Add a section to add a section to the form. A
line appears, and a section heading can be entered. When complete, click off
the line, or press enter to lock in the new section on the form.

Next, click Add a question to add a question to the section. A Create Sections
and Questions pop-up window appears where the question details are entered.
Type out the question in the top line.

There are several Question Types to choose from:

  * Multiple choice: only one answer: a multiple choice question that only allows the candidate to select one answer

  * Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed: a multiple choice question that allows the candidate to select multiple answers

  * Multiple Lines Text Box: allows the applicant to enter several lines of text

  * Single Line Text Box: limits the applicant to only a single line of text

  * Numerical Value: only allows a number to be entered

  * Date: a calendar module is presented to select a date

  * Datetime: a calendar module and a clock icon is presented to select a date and time

  * Matrix: a customizable table that allows the candidate to choose an answer for each row

After selecting a question type, a sample question appears in gray. This
represents how the question will be displayed to applicants.

![Add a new question to the interview form.](../../../_images/questions.png)

Questions and sections can be reorganized. Move them by clicking and dragging
individual section headings or question lines to their desired position(s).

Sections are indicated by a gray background, while questions have a white
background.

candidate.](../../../_images/questions-matrix.png)

##### Answers

If Multiple choice: only one answer, Multiple choice: multiple answers
allowed, Single Line Text Box, or Matrix is selected for the Question Type, an
Answers tab appears beneath the question. If another question type is
selected, the Answers tab remains hidden from view.

Multiple choiceSingle Line Text BoxMatrix

For both the Multiple choice: only one answer and Multiple choice: multiple
answers allowed question type, the answers are populated in the same way.

First, in the Answers tab, click Add a line. A line appears, and an answer can
be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line, or press enter to
lock in the new answer on the form and have another answer line appear.

If desired, an image can be attached to the answer. Click on a line to select
it, and an Upload your file button appears on the right side. Click the Upload
your file button and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the image
file, select it, then click Open to select it.

Repeat this for all the answers to be added for the multiple choice question.
The answers can be rearranged in any order. To move an answer, click on the
six small squares on the far left of each answer line, and drag the answer to
the desired position. The order the answers appear in the form is the order
the answers will appear online.

To delete a line, click on the 🗑️ (trash can) icon on the far right side of
the answer line.

![Answers to a multiple choice question, where each line has a different
answer listed.](../../../_images/multi-answers.png)

If the Single Line Text Box question type is selected, only two checkboxes
appear in the Answers tab:

  * Input must be an email: activate this option if the answer must be in the format of an email address.

    * Save as user email?: this option appears if Input must be an email is selected. This saves the email entered on the form as the user’s email, and will be used anytime Odoo contacts the user via email.

  * Save as user nickname?: activate this option to populate the answer as the user’s nickname. This is stored and used anywhere Odoo uses a nickname.

![The three possible checkboxes that can appear if a single line of text is
selected for the question type.](../../../_images/single-line.png)

Sometimes, a question is asked that does not fit a standard answer format, and
is best suited for a matrix. For example, asking an applicant what is their
availability to work compared to the various shifts is a perfect question for
a matrix format. In this example, an applicant can click on all the shifts
they are available to work.

For a Matrix question type, there are two sets of data that need to be input.
The rows and columns must both be configured. The columns are represented by
the Choices section, while the rows are configured in the Rows section.

The method for populating both sections is the same. In the Answers tab, click
Add a line in either the Choices or Row section. A line appears, and an answer
can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line, or press enter
to lock in the new answer on the form and have another answer line appear.
Repeat this for all answers for both the Choices and Rows sections.

![../../../_images/matrix.png](../../../_images/matrix.png)

This is an example matrix that asks an applicant what shifts they are
available to work on Saturdays and Sundays, either morning, afternoon, or
evening.

##### Description

Enter any information that may be helpful to an applicant. This description
will appear for this specific question only, and therefore should be question-

The answer can _only_ be verified if it is a numerical entry. When activated, several other options appear. Enter the values for the Min/Max Limits in the two fields. Next, enter the text that appears when the answer given does not fit within the designated minimum and maximum parameters. Last, enter any text in the Placeholder field to provide any additional information or directions to assist the applicant.

###### Constraints

If the question is required to be answered by the applicant, activate the box
next to Mandatory Answer. An Error message field appears, with some example
text in gray (_This question requires an answer_). Enter the message that
should appear if the applicant attempts to move on to the next question
without answering this required one. The text should explain that the question
must be answered.

###### Layout

If the question should only appear if a previous question is answered in a
specific way, activate the Conditional Display option. A new Triggering
Question field appears. Using the drop-down menu, select the previous question
this new question is linked to. Once a previous question is selected, a
Triggering Answer field appears. Select the answer that must be selected in
order for the new question to appear.

Example

To further illustrate a triggering question, the following is an example that
is applicable to recruitment. The question, `Do you have experience with
managing a sales team?` is already added. A new question is then added, `How
many years of experience?`. This question should _only_ appear if the
applicant selected `Yes` to the question `Do you have prior experience
managing a sales team?`.

To properly configure this example, activate the Conditional Display option.
Then, select `Do you have experience with managing a sales team?` as the
Triggering Question. Then, select Yes for the triggering answer.
