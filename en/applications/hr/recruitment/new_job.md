# Job positions

In the default Recruitment dashboard view, all job positions are shown,
regardless of status. Current published positions with active applicants are
shown, as well as job positions that have been created but have not yet been
published.

Each job position is shown in an individual kanban card. If the job position
is active and candidates can apply, then a **Published** banner will appear in
the top-right corner of the card.

View submitted applications by clicking anywhere on a job position card.

Enter the job description in the **Job Summary** tab. This information is what
is visible to potential applicants when searching for available jobs.

#### Recruitment

All the basic information about the job position is listed under the

</div> ![Enter job information details in the recruitment
tab.](../../../_images/recruitment-tab.png)

### Create interview form

An _Interview Form_ is used to determine if a candidate is a good fit for a
job position. Interview forms can be as specific or general as desired, and
can take the form of a certification, an exam, or a general questionnaire.
Interview forms are determined by the recruitment team.

All interview forms must be created, there are no pre-configured forms in
Konvergo ERP. To create an interview form, start from the recruitment tab of the **Job
Position** form. In the **Interview Form** field, enter a name for the new
interview form. As the name is typed, several options populate beneath the
entry, **Create (interview form name)** , **View all** , and **Create and
edit‚Ä¶**. Click **Create and edit‚Ä¶**. and a **Create Interview Form** pop-up
window appears.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The option <b>View all</b> only appears if there are any interview forms already created.
If no interview forms exist, the only options available are <b>Create (interview form
name)</b>, and <b>Create and edit‚Ä¶</b>.</p>
</div>

First, enter a name for the form in the **Name** field. This should be
indicative of when the form should be used. For example, is the form specific
to a job position, or is it a general form that can be used for all
recruitment scenarios?

Next, select what kind of interview form is being created. The default is
**Custom** , which is pre-selected. The various options are **Survey** ,
**Live session** , **Assessment** , **Custom** , and **Appraisal**.

Then select the person responsible for the form from the drop-down menu for
the **Responsible** field.

If desired, an image can be added to the interview form. Mouse over the camera
icon on the far right and a **‚úèÔ∏è (pencil)** icon appears. Click the **‚úèÔ∏è
(pencil)** icon and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired
image file, then click **Open** to select it.

![The top portion of the new interview form with everything filled out and
selected.](../../../_images/create-interview-form.png)

#### Questions

In the **Questions** tab, click on **Add a section** to add a section to the
form. A line appears, and a section heading can be entered. When complete,
click off the line, or press enter to lock in the new section on the form.

Next, click **Add a question** to add a question to the section. A **Create
Sections and Questions** pop-up window appears where the question details are
entered. Type out the question in the top line.

There are several **Question Types** to choose from:

  * **Multiple choice: only one answer** : a multiple choice question that only allows the candidate to select one answer

  * **Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed** : a multiple choice question that allows the candidate to select multiple answers

  * **Multiple Lines Text Box** : allows the applicant to enter several lines of text

  * **Single Line Text Box** : limits the applicant to only a single line of text

  * **Numerical Value** : only allows a number to be entered

  * **Date** : a calendar module is presented to select a date

  * **Datetime** : a calendar module and a clock icon is presented to select a date and time

  * **Matrix** : a customizable table that allows the candidate to choose an answer for each row

After selecting a question type, a sample question appears in gray. This
represents how the question will be displayed to applicants.

![Add a new question to the interview form.](../../../_images/questions.png)

Questions and sections can be reorganized. Move them by clicking and dragging
individual section headings or question lines to their desired position(s).

Sections are indicated by a gray background, while questions have a white
background.

![A sample of categories and questions for a
candidate.](../../../_images/questions-matrix.png)

##### Answers

If **Multiple choice: only one answer** , **Multiple choice: multiple answers
allowed** , **Single Line Text Box** , or **Matrix** is selected for the
**Question Type** , an **Answers** tab appears beneath the question. If
another question type is selected, the **Answers** tab remains hidden from
view.

Multiple choiceSingle Line Text BoxMatrix

For both the **Multiple choice: only one answer** and **Multiple choice:
multiple answers allowed** question type, the answers are populated in the
same way.

First, in the **Answers** tab, click **Add a line**. A line appears, and an
answer can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line, or
press enter to lock in the new answer on the form and have another answer line
appear.

If desired, an image can be attached to the answer. Click on a line to select
it, and an **Upload your file** button appears on the right side. Click the
**Upload your file** button and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to
the image file, select it, then click **Open** to select it.

Repeat this for all the answers to be added for the multiple choice question.
The answers can be rearranged in any order. To move an answer, click on the
six small squares on the far left of each answer line, and drag the answer to
the desired position. The order the answers appear in the form is the order
the answers will appear online.

To delete a line, click on the **üóëÔ∏è (trash can)** icon on the far right side
of the answer line.

![Answers to a multiple choice question, where each line has a different
answer listed.](../../../_images/multi-answers.png)

If the **Single Line Text Box** question type is selected, only two checkboxes
appear in the **Answers** tab:

  * **Input must be an email** : activate this option if the answer must be in the format of an email address.

    * **Save as user email?** : this option appears if **Input must be an email** is selected. This saves the email entered on the form as the user‚Äôs email, and will be used anytime Konvergo ERP contacts the user via email.

  * **Save as user nickname?** : activate this option to populate the answer as the user‚Äôs nickname. This is stored and used anywhere Konvergo ERP uses a nickname.

![The three possible checkboxes that can appear if a single line of text is
selected for the question type.](../../../_images/single-line.png)

Sometimes, a question is asked that does not fit a standard answer format, and
is best suited for a matrix. For example, asking an applicant what is their
availability to work compared to the various shifts is a perfect question for
a matrix format. In this example, an applicant can click on all the shifts
they are available to work.

For a **Matrix** question type, there are two sets of data that need to be
input. The rows and columns must both be configured. The columns are
represented by the **Choices** section, while the rows are configured in the
**Rows** section.

The method for populating both sections is the same. In the **Answers** tab,
click **Add a line** in either the **Choices** or **Row** section. A line
appears, and an answer can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off
the line, or press enter to lock in the new answer on the form and have
another answer line appear. Repeat this for all answers for both the
**Choices** and **Rows** sections.

![../../../_images/matrix.png](../../../_images/matrix.png)

This is an example matrix that asks an applicant what shifts they are
available to work on Saturdays and Sundays, either morning, afternoon, or
evening.

##### Description

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>To further illustrate a triggering question, the following is an example that is applicable to

added. A new question is then added, <code>How many years of experience?</code>. This question should <em>only</em>
appear if the applicant selected <code>Yes</code> to the question <code>Do you have prior experience managing a
