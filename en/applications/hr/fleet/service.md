# Services

To properly maintain a fleet of vehicles, regular maintenance as well as
periodic repairs are needed. Scheduling repairs and managing services for an
entire fleet is necessary to ensure all vehicles are in good working order
when they are needed.

## Create a service record

To log a service, go to the main services dashboard by navigating to Fleet app
‣ Fleet ‣ Services. Click **Create** and a service form appears. Fill in the
information on the form and click **Save**. The only two fields that are
required to be populated are **Service Type** and **Vehicle**.

The fields are:

  * **Description** : enter in a short description of the service.

  * **Service Type** : select the type of service performed from the drop-down menu, or type in a new type of service and click either **Create** or **Create & Edit…**. This list is not pre-configured in Konvergo ERP. When creating a fleet and logging a service, the types of service need to be created.

  * **Date** : using the calendar module, select the date the service was provided or is scheduled to be performed. Navigate to the desired month using the left and right arrow icons, then click on the date to select it.

  * **Cost** : enter the cost of the service.

  * **Vendor** : select the vendor who performed the service from the drop-down menu. If the vendor has not already been entered in the system, type in the vendor name and click either **Create** to add them, or **Create & Edit…** to create the vendor and edit the vendor form. The vendor form allows for other details aside form the name to be entered, such as contact information.

  * **Vehicle** : select the vehicle that was serviced from the drop-down menu. When the vehicle is selected, the **Driver** field is populated, and the unit of measure for the **Mileage** field appears.

  * **Driver** : the current driver listed for the selected vehicle is populated when the **Vehicle** is selected. If the driver needs to be changed, another driver can be selected from the drop-down menu.

  * **Odometer Value** : enter the odometer reading when the service was done. The units of measure will either be in kilometers (**km**) or miles (**mi**). When the **Vehicle** is selected, the units of measure is populated. This comes from the vehicle form. To change from kilometers to miles, or vice versa, click the **External Link** button next to the vehicle selected in the **Vehicle** field. Change the unit of measure, then click **Save**. the unit of measure will be updated in the **Odometer Value** field.

  * **Notes** : enter any notes for the repair in the notes tab at the bottom of the service form.

### View services

It is recommended to view the list of services in one of several pre-
configured ways to better view the information presented. In the top right
corner of the list, there are several icons that when clicked, sort the data
in different ways.

![The icons in the top right corner than cn be clicked to present the
information in different ways.](../../../_images/views.png)

#### List view

The default view of the services is the list view. This presents all the
services in chronological order, from oldest to newest, in a list.

The information can be sorted by any column. At the top of each column, hover
over the column name. An arrow appears to the right of the name. Click the
arrow to sort the data by that specific column.

The default sorting is descending alphabetical order (A to Z). Click the arrow
again to reverse the order, and go in reverse alphabetical order (Z to A). The
one exception to this sorting is the default **Date** column, which sorts the
information in chronological order (January to December) instead of
alphabetical order.

#### Kanban view

To view services by their stage, click on the **Kanban icon** , which is the
second icon in the top right, and appears as four black squares in a cube.

All the services with the same status appear in the corresponding column, from
**Running** to **Cancelled**. To change the status of a service, simply click
and drag the service card to the desired stage.

#### Graph view

Another way to view the data is in a graph. To view the graph, click the
**Graph icon** , which is the third icon in the top right, and appears as a
small graph.

The graph displays the information in a graph where the X axis represents the
**Date** and the Y axis represents the **Cost**. Each column represents a
single month, and then is further organized by vehicle. Each vehicle is
represented by a different color, and each month’s bar is divided by each
vehicle.

#### Pivot view

The final way to view the service data is in a spreadsheet pivot table. Click
on the **Pivot icon** , which is the last icon in the top right, and appears
as a small spreadsheet.

The data presented in the table shows the cost of each service or repair. The
rows represent the vendors, and each vehicle that was serviced by them appears
beneath each vendor. The column represent the different service types
performed.

The table can be inserted in a spreadsheet or downloaded. To add the pivot
table to a spreadsheet in Konvergo ERP, click **Insert In Spreadsheet** and a pop-up
appears. Select the spreadsheet the data should be added to from the drop-down
menu, and click **Confirm**. The spreadsheet then loads on the screen. The
spreadsheets are stored in Konvergo ERP’s _Documents_ application. To download the
table in an `xlsx` format, click the **Download** icon.
