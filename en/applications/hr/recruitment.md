# Recruitment

Konvergo ERP keeps all job applicants organized with a pre-configured series of steps
and stages that each applicant goes through. Each stage has a specific step(s)
that should be performed. These range from scheduling a phone call, conducting
an interview, to sending a job offer, just to name a few. This process is
referred to as the ‘applicant flow’.

When an applicant applies for a job position, an _applicant card_ is
automatically created in Konvergo ERP’s _Recruitment_ app for that specific job
position. As the applicant progresses through the recruitment pipeline, the
recruitment team moves their card from one stage to the next.

Stages can be configured so that an email is automatically sent out using a
set, pre-configured template as soon as an applicant’s card enters a stage.
These automated emails are defined on each stage in the applicant flow.

The applicant flow explained in this document is the default flow in Konvergo ERP, and
goes through the applicant flow when using the _Recruitment_ application’s
default configuration. The applicant flow is able to be modified to suit the
specific recruitment flow for any business.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The applicant flow with all its stages are universal and applies to all job positions, unless
specified. <a href="#recruitment-customize-stages"><span class="std std-ref">A specific stage can be configured</span></a> to be
job-specific, meaning that specific stage is only visible for that specific job position.
Otherwise, if a new stage is created, or an existing stage is modified, those changes will be
visible on all job positions.</p>
</div>

## Kanban view

To access the kanban view for a job position, navigate to the main Recruitment
app dashboard, which is the default view when opening the application. All job
positions appear on the main dashboard. Click the **New Applications** smart
button on a job position card to navigate to the kanban view for all the
applicants for that particular job position.

![Main dashboard view of job position card, showing new applications
button.](../../_images/new-applicants-button.png)

Inside the job application, the kanban stages appear, with all the applicants
populated in their respective columns, indicating what stage they are
currently in. There are five default stages in Konvergo ERP:

  * Initial Qualification

  * First Interview

  * Second Interview

  * Contract Proposal

  * Contract Signed

The last column, **Contract Signed** , is folded by default, meaning that the
column appears in gray and the applicants in it are hidden from view. To
expand the folded stage and view the applicant cards for that column, click
anywhere on the thin gray column that says the stage name and the column
expands, revealing the applicants.

![Expand a folded column by clicking on it in the kanban
view.](../../_images/stages.png)

Each stage has a color-coded bar beneath the stage name, giving information
about the applicant’s status in the stage. The colors are:

  * **Green** : there are applicants in the stage with an activity that is either already scheduled or needs to be scheduled in the future (such as a phone call or interview), according to the parameters for that particular stage.

  * **Yellow** : there are applicants in the stage with an activity either scheduled for today or due to be scheduled today.

  * **Red** : there are applicants in the stage with overdue activities which need to be scheduled.

  * **Gray** : there are either no activities currently scheduled and no future activities that are required to be scheduled, or there are no applicants currently in the stage.

## Customize stages

Stages can be modified, added, or deleted to best meet the needs of the
particular hiring steps of a business.

### New stage

To create a new stage, click on **\+ Add a Column** and a new column appears.
Enter the title for the new stage in the **Column title** field, then click
**Add**. The new column appears, and another new stage is available to create.
If no new stages are needed, click anywhere on the screen to exit the new
column creation.

![The plus sign to click in order to add a new column to the kanban
stages.](../../_images/add-column.png)

### Modify stage

To modify the settings of a stage, hover over the name of the stage, and a
**⚙️ (gear)** icon appears in the upper right hand side of the stage. Click on
the **⚙️ (gear)** icon and a menu appears. Then click on the **Edit Stage**
option. An **Edit Column** form appears. Make any modifications to the form,
then click **Save** when done.

![The gear icon that appears when a column name is moused over, and the drop-
down menu it displays when clicked.](../../_images/gear.png)

#### Edit column form

The **Edit Column** form is where the stage’s settings are configured. The
only required fields are the **Stage Name** , and the **Tooltips** section.

The fields to be populated or modified are:

  * **Stage Name** : type in a name for the stage.

  * **Email Template** : select an email template to be used from the drop-down menu. If a template is selected, when the applicant card enters the stage, an email will automatically be sent to the applicant using the selected template.

  * **Folded in Kanban** : check the box to have the stage appear folded (hidden) at all times in the default view.

  * **Hired Stage** : check the box if this stage indicates that the applicant is hired. When an applicant’s card enters this stage, the card displays a **Hired** banner in the upper right corner. If this box is checked, this stage is used to determine the hire date of an applicant.

  * **Job Specific** : if the stage only applies to a specific job position(s), select the job position(s) from the drop-down menu. Multiple job positions can be selected.

  * **Show in Referrals** : check the box if this stage should be seen in the _Referrals_ application, and allow the referrer to accrue points when a referral of theirs reaches this stage. If this is active, a **Points** field appears. Enter the amount of referral points the employee receives when an applicant enters this stage.

  * **Tooltips** section: there are three pre-configured labels (colored circles) for each applicant’s card, indicating its status. These colors are displayed at the top of each stage to reflect the statuses of the applicants in the stage. The _names_ for the label can be modified, but the label itself (the color) cannot. The default names and labels are: **In Progress** (gray), **Blocked** (red), and **Ready for Next Stage** (green).

  * **Requirements** : enter any internal notes for this stage explaining any requirements of the stage.

### Delete stage

If a stage is no longer needed, the stage can be deleted. To delete a stage,
hover over the name of the stage, and a **⚙️ (gear)** icon appears. First,
click on the **⚙️ (gear)** icon to reveal a drop-down menu, then click
**Delete**. A pop-up warning appears, asking **Are you sure you want to remove
this column?**. Click **OK** to delete the column.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>If there are applicants currently in the stage being deleted, an error pops up when attempting to
delete the stage, explaining that there are records in the stage which need to be deleted,
archived, or moved to a different stage before deleting.</p>
</div>

## Email templates

To communicate with the applicant, Konvergo ERP has several pre-configured email
templates that can be used. The pre-configured email templates and when to use
them are as follows:

  * **Applicant: Acknowledgement** : this template is used to let the applicant know that their application was received. This email is automatically sent out once the applicant is in the **First Interview** stage.

  * **Applicant: Interest** : this template is used to let the applicant know that they have passed the **Initial Qualification** stage and they will be contacted to set up an interview with the recruiter.

  * **Applicant: Not interested anymore** : this template is used when an applicant communicates that they are no longer interested in the position, and thanks them for their time and consideration.

  * **Applicant: Refuse** : this template is used when an applicant is no longer being considered for the position.

  * **Applicant: Your Salary Package** : this template is used when offering an applicant a position. This informs the applicant they can configure their salary package.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Email templates can be created, modified, and deleted to suit the needs of a business. For more
information on email templates, refer to the <a href="../general/companies/email_template">Email templates</a> document.</p>
</div>

To manually send an email click **Send message** in the chatter. A text box
appears, as well as the applicant’s email address. Click the **⤢ (double
arrow)** full composer icon in the bottom right corner of the **Send Message**
tab in the chatter.

![Send an email from the chatter.](../../_images/full-composer.png)

An email composer pop-up loads, with the **Recipients** and **Subject** pre-
populated. The applicant’s email address is entered on the **Recipients**
line, and the **Subject** is `Re: (Subject / Application Name)`. The email
body is empty by default.

To use a pre-configured email template, click the drop-down next to the **Load
template** field in the lower right section of the window. Pre-configured
email templates may contain dynamic placeholders so unique information can be
populated in the email for a more personalized message to the applicant. There
are several pre-configured email templates to choose from. Depending on the
template selected, the email subject and/or body may change.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Only the email templates that are configured for the model will load. There are other email
templates pre-configured in Konvergo ERP, but if they are not configured for the recruitment application,
they will not appear in the list of available templates.</p>
</div>

If any attachments are to be added, click the **Attach A File** button in the
lower left corner. Navigate to the file to be attached, then click **Open** to
attach it. To delete an attachment, click the **X (Delete)** icon to the right
of the attachment. If any changes need to be made to the email, edit the body
of the email. If the edits should be saved to be used in the future, the email
can be saved as a new template. Click the **Save As New Template** button in
the bottom right corner. To send the email, click **Send** and the email will
be sent to the applicant. The email then appears in the chatter.

## Stage flow

In order to move an applicant’s card from one stage to another, the
applicant’s card can either be dragged and dropped in the kanban view to the
desired stage, or the stage can be modified on the applicant’s card.

To change the stage on the applicant’s card, click on the applicant’s card in
the kanban view to go to a detailed view of the card. The current stage for
the card is highlighted in purple at the top, above the card. Simply click the
desired stage for the card, and the stage changes. A log note indicating the
stage change appears in the chatter. Navigate back to the kanban view by
clicking on **Applications** in the breadcrumb menu in the top left, and the
applicant’s card now appears in the new stage.

![Change the stage of an applicant by clicking on the desired stage at the top
of the applicant's card.](../../_images/stage-change.png)

### Initial qualification

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>The following information is based on Konvergo ERP’s default recruitment pipeline flow. Be advised that
if modifications are made to create a customized recruitment pipeline flow, it will vary from the
following information.</p>
</div>

All applicants appear in the **Initial Qualification** stage, whether
submitted online or if the applicant is manually entered by a recruiter. When
the applicant’s card is created, Konvergo ERP automatically populates the applicant’s
**Name** , **Email address** , and **Phone number** on the applicant’s card.
This information is required when applying for a job position.

If the applicant entered any information in the **Short Introduction** section
of the online application, it is populated in the **Application Summary** tab
at the bottom of the applicant’s card. If a resumé was attached to the online
application, the resumé appears in the attachments section of the chatter, and
is also stored in the _Documents_ application. To find the recruitment
documents stored in the Documents application, navigate to the main Documents
dashboard, and click the folder labeled **Recruitment** on the right side. All
recruitment documents will be stored within that folder.

#### Send interview

At any point in the hiring process, an _interview_ can be sent to the
applicant to obtain more information. These interviews are custom-made, and
can be formatted in a variety of ways.

Konvergo ERP uses the term _interview_ , but these can be thought of as
questionnaires, surveys, tests, certifications, etc. Custom interviews can be
formatted to suit each individual job position’s needs. For example, a job
position for a computer programmer could have an interview in the form of a
programming quiz to determine the skill level of the applicant. A job position
for a restaurant server could have a questionnaire inquiring about the
applicant’s availability, if the desired applicant needs to be available on
weekend evenings. For more information on creating and editing interview
forms, refer to the [Job positions](recruitment/new_job) documentation.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>In order to send an email to an applicant, there must be an email address on the applicant’s
card. If an email address is not entered on the applicant’s card, when <b>Send Interview</b>
is clicked, the applicant’s card appears instead of the <b>Survey</b> pop-up window. Enter
the email address in the email field, then click <b>Save</b>. Once the applicant’s card is
saved, the applicant’s card closes and the <b>Survey</b> pop-up window appears.</p>
</div>

To send an interview to an applicant, click on an applicant’s card to navigate
to a detailed view of the applicant’s card. At the top of the applicant’s
card, click the button labeled **Send Interview**.

If the applicant’s card has an email address on file, a **Survey** pop-up
window appears, with all the information populated. If an email is not on the
applicant’s card, then a contact form appears. Enter the applicants email
address, then click **Save**. The card closes and the **Survey** pop-up window
appears.

Konvergo ERP refers to the interview forms as _surveys_. These email templates also
use dynamic placeholders to personalize the email to the applicant and the job
position. Add any additional recipients for the survey if more people should
receive the email. If an email is in the database as a contact, add that
contact on the **Recipients** line. If an email should be sent to someone who
is not in the database as a contact, and they should **not** be added as a
contact, add their email to the **Additional emails** line.

If any attachments need to be added, click the **Attachments** button and a
file explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired file, then click
**Open** to attach it to the email. The attachment loads, and is listed above
the **Attachments** button.

If the emailed interview must be completed by a specific date, select a date
for the **Answer deadline** in the lower-right area of the pop-up window.
Click on the line next to **Answer deadline** , and a calendar selector
appears. Use the **< (left)** and **> (right)** arrows on either side of the
month to navigate to the desired month, then click on the **day** to select
the date.

The **Mail template** field is pre-populated based on the configuration for
the interview. A different template can be chosen from the drop-down menu if
desired. If a new template is selected, the new email template loads in the
email body.

To send the email with the interview link to the applicant, click **Send** at
the bottom of the email pop-up.

![Send a custom survey, also referred to as an interview form, to an applicant
using a pre-configured template.](../../_images/send-survey.png)

#### Refuse

At any point in the recruitment pipeline, an applicant can be refused from the
job application process. To refuse an applicant, click on an applicant’s card
to navigate to a detailed view of the applicant’s card. At the top of the
applicant’s card, there are several buttons. Click the one labeled **Refuse**.

A **Refuse Reason** pop-up appears. Select the **Refuse Reason** from the
drop-down menu. The default refuse reasons in Konvergo ERP are: **Doesn’t fit the job
requirements** , **The applicant is not interested anymore** , and **The
applicant gets a better offer**. These three refusal reasons have pre-
configured email templates associated with them. Additional refusal reasons
can be created and existing ones can be modified or deleted. To add a new
refusal reason, type in the name of the reason, then click **Create and
Edit…**. A **Create: Refuse Reason** pop-up window appears. Type in the name
of the new email template in the **Email Template** field, and click **Create
and Edit…**. A **Create: Email Template** window loads. Configure the new
email template, then click **Save**.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Pre-configured email templates in Konvergo ERP sometimes use dynamic placeholders, which are customized
pieces of data that populate dynamic content. For example, if the applicant’s name is a piece of
dynamic content, the applicant’s name will appear anytime that dynamic placeholder appears on the
email template. For more detailed information on email templates, refer to the
<a href="../general/companies/email_template">Email templates</a> documentation.</p>
</div>

An email template populates the **Email Template** field after a refusal
reason is selected. If an email should not be sent to the applicant, uncheck
the **Send Email** checkbox. To view the email template, click the **External
Link** icon to the right of the email template selected. The email template
loads in the pop-up window, and can be modified if needed. After making
modifications, click **Save**. To close the email template, click **Discard**.

To send the refusal email to the applicant, click **Send**. The refusal email
is sent to the applicant, and a **Refused** banner appears on the applicant’s
card.

![An applicant's card with the refused banner appearing in the top right
corner in red.](../../_images/refuse.png)

After refusal, the applicant’s card is no longer visible in the job position’s
kanban view. To view refused applicants, navigate to the Recruitment app ‣
Applications ‣ All Applications. All applications for all job positions are
presented in a list view. To view the refused applicants only, click
**Filters** , then click **Archived/Refused**. All applicants that have been
archived and/or refused appear in the list. To further organize this list and
view refusals by job position, click **≣ Group By** , then click **Job**.

#### New applicant

An applicant card can be manually added if needed. If an applicant needs to be
added to the list of prospective candidates and an applicant card has not been
created yet (they have not applied for the job online yet) an applicant card
can be easily added from the job position kanban view in one of two ways,
using either the Quick add icon or the Create button.

##### Quick add

Quickly add a new applicant using the **Quick add** icon. If not already in
the job position kanban view, navigate to the main recruitment dashboard, and
click the **New Applicants** button on the job position card that the
applicant should be added to. Then, click on the small **\+ (plus sign) Quick
add** icon in the top right of the **Initial Qualification** stage to quickly
add a new applicant.

![All the fields for a new applicant form entered when using the Quick Add
option.](../../_images/quick-add.png)

Enter the following information on the card:

  * **Subject/Application Name** : this is the only required field. Enter the title for the card. Typically this is the applicant’s name and job position being applied to, for example: `Laura Smith - Experienced Developer`.

  * **Applicant’s Name** : enter the applicant’s name.

  * **Email** : enter the applicant’s email address.

  * **Applied Job** : the current job position populates this field. If needed, the job position can be changed by selecting a different position from the drop-down menu. If a different job position is selected, after the card is created, the card will appear in the selected job position.

After the information is entered, click **Add**. The applicant appears in the
list, and a new blank applicant card appears. Click either the **🗑️ (delete)**
icon or click anywhere on the screen to close the card.

If preferred, after entering the applicant name, click **Edit** and a detailed
**Applicant Form** loads. Enter the information on the form, then click
**Save**

![An applicant's card moves from one stage t another by using the click and
drag method.](../../_images/move.png)

When the applicant’s card moves to the **First Interview** stage, an
acknowledgement email is automatically sent to the applicant. The email is
created using an email template titled **Applicant: Acknowledgement**. This

Each command presents a different pop-up window. Follow the instructions for each command to complete the entry.

  * **Reminders** : select a reminder from the drop-down menu. Options include **Notification** , **Email** , and **SMS Text Message** , each with a specific time period before the event (hours, days, etc).

  * **Show as** : select from the drop-down whether the meeting time should appear as **Busy** or **Available** in the attendees’ schedules. Setting this field to **Available** allows other meetings to be scheduled for the same time. It is recommended to set this field to **Busy** , so no other meetings can be scheduled for the attendees at the same time.

![A new meeting card with all the details populated, and ready to

**Recipients** by default. Add the applicant’s email address to the list to
send the email to the applicant as well. Make any other desired changes to the
email. If an attachment is needed, click the **Attach A File** button,
navigate to the file, then click **Open**. Once the email is ready to be sent,

list of attendees. A **Send SMS Text Message** pop-up appears. At the top, in
a blue box, information appears regarding the message. The first line lists
how many records (phone numbers) are selected. The second line lists the
number of recipients and how many of them are invalid. If a contact does not
have a valid phone number listed, click **Close** , and edit the attendee’s
record, then redo these steps.

### Second interview

After an applicant has passed the **First Interview** stage, they can be moved
to the **Second Interview** stage. To move the applicant to the next stage,
drag and drop the applicant’s card to the **Second Interview** stage, or click
on the **Second Interview** stage button at the top of the individual
applicant’s card.

When the applicant’s card moves to the **Second Interview** stage, there are
no automatic activities or emails configured for this stage, unlike for the

with the applicant, following the same process as for the first interview.

### Contract proposal

sent, they can be moved to the **Contract Proposal** stage. Drag and drop the
applicant’s card to the **Contract Proposal** stage, or click on the
**Contract Proposal** stage button at the top right of the individual
applicant’s card.

The next step is to send an offer to the applicant. On the applicant’s card,
click the **Generate Offer** button. A **Generate a Simulation Link** pop-up
appears. All fields are pre-populated with information from the job position,
except for the **Force New Cars List** , **Default Vehicle** , and the
**Canteen Cost** (this is set to `0.00`).

#### Send offer

To send the offer to the applicant, click **Send**. If the applicant does not
have an email address listed on their applicant card, the applicant form
appears so their email can be configured. If there is already an email
configured on the applicant’s card, the email pop-up appears instead. If
prompted with the applicant’s card, enter the applicant’s email address in the
**Email** field, then click **Save**. The applicant form closes and the email
pop-up appears.

**Recipients** , **Subject** , and email body are pre-populated based on the
email template. If any attachments need to be added, click the **Attachments**
button and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired file, then

**Contract Signed** stage, or click the **More** button at the top of the
applicant’s card to reveal the **Contract Signed** stage button at the top of
the individual applicant’s card, and click **Contract Signed**.

The **Contract Signed** stage is folded in the kanban view, but the card may
still be dragged and dropped into that stage.

Once the applicant’s card moves to the **Contract Signed** stage, a green
**Hired** banner appears in the top right of the applicant’s card.
