## Kiosk management

A kiosk is a self-service station that allows employees to check in and check
out for work shifts.

There are two ways to set up a kiosk:

  * **Laptop and desktop PC**

Running a kiosk in a web browser is the cheapest and most flexible option. You
can print employee badges with any thermal or inkjet printer compatible with
your web browser.

  * **Tablet and mobile phone (Android or iOS)**

Tablets and mobile phones take up much less space, and their touchscreens are
easy to use. Consider putting them in a secure stand at the front desk or
mounting them securely on a wall.

## Barcode scanners

Employees can scan the barcode on their employee badges to manage check-ins
and check-outs quickly and easily. The kiosk mode works with most USB barcode
scanners connected directly to a computer. Bluetooth barcode scanners are also
supported natively.
