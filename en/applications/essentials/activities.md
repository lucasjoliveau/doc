# Activities

_Activities_ are follow-up tasks tied to a record in an Konvergo ERP database.
Activities can be scheduled on any page of the database that contains a
chatter thread, kanban view, list view, or activities view of an application.

## Schedule activities

One way that activities are created is by clicking the **Schedule Activity**
button, located at the top of the _chatter_ on any record. On the pop-up
window that appears, select an **Activity Type** from the drop-down menu.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Individual applications have a list of <em>Activity Types</em> dedicated to that application. For
example, to view and edit the activities available for the <em>CRM</em> application, go to
CRM app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Activity Types.</p>
</div>

Enter a title for the activity in the **Summary** field, located in the
**Schedule Activity** pop-up window.

To assign the activity to a different user, select a name from the **Assigned
to** drop-down menu. Otherwise, the user creating the activity is
automatically assigned.

Lastly, feel free to add any additional information in the optional **Log a
note‚Ä¶** field.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>The <b>Due Date</b> field on the <b>Schedule Activity</b> pop-up window auto-populates
based on the configuration settings for the selected <b>Activity Type</b>. However, this
date can be changed by selecting a day on the calendar in the <b>Due Date</b> field.</p>
</div>

Lastly, click one of the following buttons:

  * **Schedule** : adds the activity to the chatter under **Planned activities**.

  * **Mark as Done** : adds the details of the activity to the chatter under **Today**. The activity is not scheduled, it is automatically marked as completed.

  * **Done & Schedule Next**: adds the task under **Today** marked as done, and opens a new activity window.

  * **Discard** : discards any changes made on the pop-up window.

</div>

Scheduled activities are added to the chatter for the record under **Planned
activities**.

## View scheduled activities

To view scheduled activities, open either the Sales app or CRM app and click
the **üïò (clock)** icon, located to the far-right side of the other view
options.

Doing so opens the activities menu, showcasing all the scheduled activities
for the user, by default. To show all activities for every user, remove the
**My Pipeline** filter from the **Search‚Ä¶** bar.

To view a consolidated list of activities separated by the application where
they were created, and by deadline, click the **üïò (clock)** icon on the header
menu to see the activities for that specific application in a drop-down menu.

The possibility to **Add new note** and **Request a Document** appear at the
bottom of this drop-down menu, when the **üïò (clock)** icon on the header menu
is clicked.

### Activity settings

#### Action

The _Action_ field specifies the intent of the activity. Some actions trigger
specific behaviors after an activity is scheduled.

  * If **Upload Document** is selected, a link to upload a document is added directly to the planned activity in the chatter.

  * If either **Phonecall** or **Meeting** are selected, users have the option to open their calendar to schedule a time for this activity.

  * If **Request Signature** is selected, a link is added to the planned activity in the chatter that opens a signature request pop-up window.
