# Activities

_Activities_ are follow-up tasks tied to a record in an Odoo database.
Activities can be scheduled on any page of the database that contains a
chatter thread, kanban view, list view, or activities view of an application.

## Schedule activities

One way that activities are created is by clicking the Schedule Activity
button, located at the top of the _chatter_ on any record. On the pop-up
window that appears, select an Activity Type from the drop-down menu.

Tip

Individual applications have a list of _Activity Types_ dedicated to that
application. For example, to view and edit the activities available for the
_CRM_ application, go to CRM app ‣ Configuration ‣ Activity Types.

Enter a title for the activity in the Summary field, located in the Schedule
Activity pop-up window.

To assign the activity to a different user, select a name from the Assigned to
drop-down menu. Otherwise, the user creating the activity is automatically
assigned.

Lastly, feel free to add any additional information in the optional Log a
note… field.

Note

The Due Date field on the Schedule Activity pop-up window auto-populates based
on the configuration settings for the selected Activity Type. However, this
date can be changed by selecting a day on the calendar in the Due Date field.

Lastly, click one of the following buttons:

  * Schedule: adds the activity to the chatter under Planned activities.

  * Mark as Done: adds the details of the activity to the chatter under Today. The activity is not scheduled, it is automatically marked as completed.

  * Done & Schedule Next: adds the task under Today marked as done, and opens a new activity window.

  * Discard: discards any changes made on the pop-up window.

Note

Depending on the activity type, the Schedule button may be replaced by a Save
button, or an Open Calendar button.

Scheduled activities are added to the chatter for the record under Planned
activities.

Activities can also be scheduled from the kanban, list, or activities view of
an application.

To open the activity view for an application, select the 🕘 (clock) icon from
the menu bar anywhere in the database. Select any application from the drop-
down menu, and click the 🕘 (clock) icon for the desired app.

the desired activity type, then click the ＋ (plus sign).

Note

Activity colors, and their relation to an activity’s due date, is consistent
throughout Odoo, regardless of the activity type, or the view.

  * Activities that appear in **green** indicate a due date sometime in the future.

  * **Yellow** indicates that the activity’s due date is today.

  * **Red** indicates that the activity is overdue and the due date has passed.

For example, if an activity is created for a phone call, and the due date
passes, the activity appears with a red phone in list view, and a red clock on
the kanban view.

## View scheduled activities

To view scheduled activities, open either the Sales app or CRM app and click
the 🕘 (clock) icon, located to the far-right side of the other view options.

Doing so opens the activities menu, showcasing all the scheduled activities
for the user, by default. To show all activities for every user, remove the My
Pipeline filter from the Search… bar.

To view a consolidated list of activities separated by the application where
they were created, and by deadline, click the 🕘 (clock) icon on the header
menu to see the activities for that specific application in a drop-down menu.

The possibility to Add new note and Request a Document appear at the bottom of
this drop-down menu, when the 🕘 (clock) icon on the header menu is clicked.

### Activity settings

#### Action

The _Action_ field specifies the intent of the activity. Some actions trigger
specific behaviors after an activity is scheduled.

  * If Upload Document is selected, a link to upload a document is added directly to the planned activity in the chatter.

  * If either Phonecall or Meeting are selected, users have the option to open their calendar to schedule a time for this activity.

  * If Request Signature is selected, a link is added to the planned activity in the chatter that opens a signature request pop-up window.

Note

The actions available to select on an activity type vary, depending on the
applications currently installed in the database.

#### Default user

To automatically assign this activity to a specific user when this activity
type is scheduled, choose a name from the Default User drop-down menu. If this
field is left blank, the activity is assigned to the user who creates the
activity.

#### Default summary

To include notes whenever this activity type is created, enter them into the
Default Summary field.

Note

The information in the Default User and Default Summary fields are included
when an activity is created. However, they can be altered before the activity
is scheduled or saved.

### Next activity

To automatically suggest, or trigger, a new activity after an activity has
been marked complete, the Chaining Type must be set.

#### Suggest next activity

In the Chaining Type field, select Suggest Next Activity. Upon doing so, the
field underneath changes to: Suggest. Click the Suggest field drop-down menu
to select any activities to recommend as follow-up tasks to this activity
type.

In the Schedule field, choose a default deadline for these activities. To do
so, configure a desired number of Days, Weeks, or Months. Then, decide if it
should occur after completion date or after previous activity deadline.

This Schedule field information can be altered before the activity is
scheduled.

When all configurations are complete, click Save.

![Schedule activity popup with emphasis on recommended
activities.](../../_images/schedule-recommended-activity.png)

Note

If an activity has the Chaining Type set to Suggest Next Activity, and has
activities listed in the Suggest field, users are presented with
recommendations for activities as next steps.

#### Trigger next activity

Setting the Chaining Type to Trigger Next Activity immediately launches the
next activity once the previous one is completed.

If Trigger Next Activity is selected in the Chaining Type field, the field
beneath changes to: Trigger. From the Trigger field drop-down menu, select the
activity that should be launched once this activity is completed.

In the Schedule field, choose a default deadline for these activities. To do
so, configure a desired number of Days, Weeks, or Months. Then, decide if it
should occur after completion date or after previous activity deadline.

This Schedule field information can be altered before the activity is
scheduled.

When all configurations are complete, click Save.

When an activity has the Chaining Type set to Trigger Next Activity, marking
the activity as `Done` immediately launches the next activity listed in the
Trigger field.
