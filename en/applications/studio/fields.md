# Fields and widgets

Fields structure the models of a database. If you picture a model as a table
or spreadsheet, fields are the columns where data is stored in the records
(i.e., the rows). Fields also define the type of data that is stored within
them. How the data is presented and formatted on the UI is defined by their
widget.

From a technical point of view, there are 15 field types in Konvergo ERP. However, you
can choose from 20 fields in Studio, as some field types are available more
than once with a different default widget.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p><b>New Fields</b> can only be added to the <a href="views#studio-views-general-form"><span class="std std-ref">Form</span></a> and
<a href="views#studio-views-multiple-records-list"><span class="std std-ref">List</span></a> views. On other views, you can only add
<b>Existing Fields</b> <span class="dfn"><span>(fields already on the model)</span></span>.</p>
</div>

## Simple fields

Simple fields contain basic values, such as text, numbers, files, etc.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Non-default widgets, when available, are presented as bullet points below.</p>
</div>

### Text (`char`)

The **Text** field is used for short text containing any character. One text
line is displayed when filling out the field.

  * **Badge** : displays the value inside a rounded shape, similar to a tag. The value cannot be edited on the UI, but a default value can be set.

  * **Copy to Clipboard** : users can copy the value by clicking a button.

  * **E-mail** : the value becomes a clickable _mailto_ link.

  * **Image** : displays an image using a URL. The value cannot be edited manually, but a default value can be set.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>This works differently than selecting the <a href="#studio-fields-simple-fields-image"><span class="std std-ref">Image field</span></a> directly, as the image is not stored in Konvergo ERP when using a
<b>Text</b> field with the <b>Image</b> widget. For example, it can be useful if you
want to save disk space.</p>
</div>

  * **Phone** : the value becomes a clickable _tel_ link.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Tip</p><p>Tick <b>Enable SMS</b> to add an option to send an SMS directly from Konvergo ERP next to the
field.</p>
</div>

  * **URL** : the value becomes a clickable URL.

### Multiline Text (`text`)

The **Multiline Text** field is used for longer text containing any type of
character. Two text lines are displayed on the UI when filling out the field.

</div>

### Decimal (`float`)

zero, with a decimal).

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>Decimal numbers are displayed with two decimals after the decimal point on the UI, but they are
stored in the database with more precision.</p>
</div>

  * **Monetary** : it is similar to using the Monetary field. It is recommended to use the later as it offers more functionalities.

  * **Percentage** : displays a percent character `%` after the value.

  * **Percentage Pie** : displays the value inside a percentage circle, usually for a computed value. The field cannot be edited manually, but a default value can be set.

</div>

### Monetary (`monetary`)

The **Monetary** field is used for all monetary values.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>When you first add a <b>Monetary</b> field, you are prompted to add a <b>Currency</b>
field if none exists already on the model. Konvergo ERP offers to add the <b>Currency</b> field for
you. Once it is added, add the <b>Monetary</b> field again.</p>

### Priority (`selection`)

The **Priority** field is used to display a three-star rating system, which
can be used to indicate importance or satisfaction level. This field type is a
Selection field with the **Priority** widget selected by default and four
priority values predefined. Consequently, the **Badge** , **Badges** ,
**Radio** , and **Selection** widgets have the same effects as described under
Selection.

### File (`binary`)

The **File** field is used to upload any type of file, or sign a form
(**Sign** widget).

</div>9

### Image (`binary`)

The **Image** field is used to upload an image and display it in [Form
view](views#studio-views-general-form). This field type is a File field
with the **Image** widget selected by default. Consequently, the **File** ,

File.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>This works differently than selecting the <a href="#studio-fields-simple-fields-image"><span class="std std-ref">Image field</span></a> directly, as the image is not stored in Konvergo ERP when using a
<b>Text</b> field with the <b>Image</b> widget. For example, it can be useful if you
want to save disk space.</p>
</div>0

### Sign (`binary`)

The **Sign** field is used to sign the form electronically. This field type is
a File field with the **Sign** widget selected by default. Consequently, the
**File** , **Image** , and **PDF Viewer** widgets have the same effects as
described under File.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>This works differently than selecting the <a href="#studio-fields-simple-fields-image"><span class="std std-ref">Image field</span></a> directly, as the image is not stored in Konvergo ERP when using a

want to save disk space.</p>
</div>2

### Many2One (`many2one`)

The **Many2One** field is used to link another record (from another model) to
the record being edited. The recordâ€™s name from the other model is then
displayed on the record being edited.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>This works differently than selecting the <a href="#studio-fields-simple-fields-image"><span class="std std-ref">Image field</span></a> directly, as the image is not stored in Konvergo ERP when using a

want to save disk space.</p>
</div>6

### Lines (`one2many`)

The **Lines** field is used to create a table with rows and columns (e.g., the
lines of products on a sales order).

<div class="alert alert-primary">

The **Many2Many** field is used to link multiple records from another model to
multiple records on the current model. Many2Many fields can use **Disable
creation** , **Disable opening** , **Domain** , just like Many2One fields.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>This works differently than selecting the <a href="#studio-fields-simple-fields-image"><span class="std std-ref">Image field</span></a> directly, as the image is not stored in Konvergo ERP when using a

</div>9

  * **Checkboxes** : users can select several values using checkboxes.

  * **Tags** : users can select several values appearing in rounded shapes, also known as _tags_. This has the same effect as selecting the Tags field.

### Tags (`many2many`)

The **Tags** field is used to display several values from another model
appearing in rounded shapes, also known as _tags_. This field type is a
Many2Many field with the **Tags** widget selected by default. Consequently,
the **Checkboxes** and **Many2Many** widgets have the same effects as
described under Many2Many.

created between models. It uses an existing relationship to fetch and display
information from another record.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
