## Installation

Depending on the intended use case, there are multiple ways to install Odoo -
or not install it at all.

  * [Online](administration/odoo_online.html) is the easiest way to use Odoo in production or to try it.

  * [Packaged installers](administration/on_premise/packages.html) are suitable for testing Odoo and developing modules. They can be used for long-term production with additional deployment and maintenance work.

  * [Source install](administration/on_premise/source.html) provides greater flexibility, as it allows, for example, running multiple Odoo versions on the same system. It is adequate to develop modules and can be used as a base for production deployment.

  * A [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo/) base image is available for development or deployment.

## Editions

There are two different editions.

**Odoo Community** is the free and open-source version of the software,
licensed under the [GNU
LGPLv3](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/master/LICENSE). It is the core upon
which Odoo Enterprise is built.

**Odoo Enterprise** is the shared source version of the software, giving
access to more functionalities, including functional support, upgrades, and
hosting. [Pricing](https://www.odoo.com/pricing-plan) starts from one app
free.

Tip

[Switch from Community to
Enterprise](administration/on_premise/community_to_enterprise.html) at any
time (except for the source install).
