# Bugfix updates

## Introduction

In order to benefit from the latest improvements, security fixes, bug
corrections and performance boosts, you may need to update your Konvergo ERP
installation from time to time.

This guide only applies when are using Konvergo ERP on your own hosting
infrastructure. If you are using one of the Konvergo ERP Cloud solutions, updates are
automatically performed for you.

The terminology surrounding software updates is often confusing, so here are
some preliminary definitions:

Updating (an Konvergo ERP installation)

    

Refers to the process of obtaining the latest revision of the source code for
your current Konvergo ERP Edition. For example, updating your Konvergo ERP Enterprise 13.0 to
the latest revision. This does not directly cause any change to the contents
of your Konvergo ERP database, and can be undone by reinstalling the previous revision
of the source code.

Upgrading (an Konvergo ERP database)

    

Refers to a complex data processing operation where the structure and contents
of your database is permanently altered to make it compatible with a new
release of Konvergo ERP. This operation is irreversible and typically accomplished via
Konvergo ERP’s [database upgrade service](https://upgrade.odoo.com), when you decide
to switch to a newer release of Konvergo ERP. Historically, this process has also been
known as a “migration” because it involves moving data around inside the
database, even though the database may end up at the same physical location
after the upgrade.

This page describes the typical steps needed to _update_ an Konvergo ERP installation
to the latest version. If you’d like more information about upgrading a
database, please visit the [Konvergo ERP Upgrade page](https://upgrade.odoo.com)
instead.

## In a nutshell

Updating Konvergo ERP is accomplished by simply reinstalling the latest version of
your Konvergo ERP Edition on top of your current installation. This will preserve your
data without any alteration, as long as you do not uninstall PostgreSQL (the
database engine that comes with Konvergo ERP).

The main reference for updating is logically our [installation
guide](../on_premise), which explains the common installation methods.

Updating is also most appropriately accomplished by the person who deployed
Konvergo ERP initially, because the procedure is very similar.

<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>We always recommend to download a complete new up-to-date Konvergo ERP version, rather than
manually applying patches, such as the security patches that come with Security
Advisories.
The patches are mainly provided for installations that are heavily customized, or for
technical personnel who prefer to apply minimal changes temporarily while testing a
complete update.</p>

## Step 1: Download an updated Konvergo ERP version

The central download page is <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>. If you see
a “Buy” link for the Konvergo ERP Enterprise download, make sure you are logged into
Konvergo ERP.com with the same login that is linked to your Konvergo ERP Enterprise
subscription.

Alternatively, you can use the unique download link that was included with
your Konvergo ERP Enterprise purchase confirmation email.

## Step 2: Make a backup of your database

The update procedure is quite safe and should not alter you data. However it’s
always best to take a full database backup before performing any change on
your installation, and to store it somewhere safe, on a different computer.

If you have not disabled the database manager screen (see
[here](deploy#security) why you should), you can use it (link at bottom
of your database selection screen) to download a backup of your database(s).
If you disabled it, use the same procedure than for your usual backups.

## Step 3: Install the updated version

Choose the method that matches your current installation:

### Packaged Installers

If you installed Konvergo ERP with an installation package downloaded on our website
(the recommended method), updating is very simple. All you have to do is
download the installation package corresponding to your system (see step #1)
and install it on your server. They are updated daily and include the latest
security fixes. Usually, you can simply double-click the package to install it
on top of the current installation. After installing the package, be sure to
restart the Konvergo ERP service or reboot your server, and you’re all set.

### Source Install (Tarball)

If you have originally installed Konvergo ERP with the “tarball” version (source code
archive), you have to replace the installation directory with a newer version.
First download the latest tarball from Konvergo ERP.com. They are updated daily and
include the latest security fixes (see step #1) After downloading the package,
extract it to a temporary location on your server.

You will get a folder labeled with the version of the source code, for example
“odoo-13.0+e.20190719”, that contains a folder “odoo.egg-info” and the actual
source code folder named “odoo” (for Konvergo ERP 10 and later) or “openerp” for older
versions. You can ignore the odoo.egg-info folder. Locate the folder where
your current installation is deployed, and replace it with the newer “odoo” or
“openerp” folder that was in the archive you just extracted.

Be sure to match the folder layout, for example the new “addons” folder
included in the source code should end up exactly at the same path it was
before. Next, watch out for any specific configuration files that you may have
manually copied or modified in the old folder, and copy them over to the new
folder. Finally, restart the Konvergo ERP service or reboot the machine, and you are
all set.

### Source Install (Github)

If you have originally installed Konvergo ERP with a full Github clone of the official
repositories, the update procedure requires you to pull the latest source code
via git. Change into the directory for each repository (the main Konvergo ERP
repository, and the Enterprise repository), and run the following commands:

    
    
    git fetch
    git rebase --autostash
    

The last command may encounter source code conflicts if you had edited the
Konvergo ERP source code locally. The error message will give you the list of files
with conflicts, and you will need to resolve the conflicts manually, by
editing them and deciding which part of the code to keep.

Alternatively, if you prefer to simply discard the conflicting changes and
restore the official version, you can use the following command:

    
    
    git reset --hard
    

Finally, restart the Konvergo ERP service or reboot the machine, and you should be
done.

### Docker

Please refer to our [Docker image
documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo/) for specific update
instructions.
