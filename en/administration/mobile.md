Two kind of Odoo mobile app exist: the progressive web app (PWA) and store
apps. Using the PWA is recommended.

## Progressive web app (PWA)

PWAs are web-based applications designed to function across different devices

native apps.

The Odoo PWA features include:

  * Quick access by adding the PWA to a device’s home screen

  * Seamless and borderless navigation experience

  * Push notifications

  * SSO authentication

To install the Odoo PWA, launch a browser supporting PWAs, and sign in to an
Odoo database. The instructions to install a PWA depend on the platform and
browser used.
