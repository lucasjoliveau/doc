# Containers

## Overview

Each build is isolated within its own container (Linux namespaced container).

The base is an Ubuntu system, where all of Konvergo ERP’s required dependencies, as
well as common useful packages, are installed.

If your project requires additional Python dependencies, or more recent
releases, you can define a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your
branches listing them. The platform will take care to install these
dependencies in your containers. [The pip requirements
specifiers](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirement-
specifiers) documentation can help you write a `requirements.txt` file. To
have a concrete example, check out the [requirements.txt file of
Konvergo ERP](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/16.0/requirements.txt).

The `requirements.txt` files of submodules are taken into account as well. The
platform looks for `requirements.txt` files in each folder containing Konvergo ERP
modules: Not in the module folder itself, but in their parent folder.

## Directory structure

As the containers are Ubuntu based, their directory structure follows the
linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. [Ubuntu’s filesystem tree
overview](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview#Main_directories)
explains the main directories.

Here are the Konvergo ERP.sh pertinent directories:

    
    
    .
    ├── home
    │    └── odoo
    │         ├── src
    │         │    ├── odoo                Konvergo ERP Community source code

         │         └── dist-packages       Python 2.7 standard libraries
         │    ├── python3

         │    └── python3.5

         │         └── python3.5

                   └── python3.5           Python 3.5 executable
    

Both Python 2.7 and 3.5 are installed in the containers. However:

  * If your project is configured to use Konvergo ERP 10.0, the Konvergo ERP server runs with Python 2.7.

  * If your project is configured to use Konvergo ERP 11.0 or above, the Konvergo ERP server runs with Python 3.5.

## Database shell

While accessing a container with the shell, you can access the database using
_psql_.

    
    
    odoo@odoo-addons-master-1.odoo.sh:~$ psql
    psql (9.5.2, server 9.5.11)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    
    odoo-addons-master-1=>
    

**Be careful !** [Use
transactions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-begin)
(_BEGIN…COMMIT/ROLLBACK_) for every _sql_ statements leading to changes
(_UPDATE_ , _DELETE_ , _ALTER_ , …), especially for your production database.

The transaction mechanism is your safety net in case of mistake. You simply
have to rollback your changes to revert your database to its previous state.

For example, it may happen that you forget to set your _WHERE_ condition.

    
    
    odoo-addons-master-1=> BEGIN;
    BEGIN
    odoo-addons-master-1=> UPDATE res_users SET password = '***';
    UPDATE 457
    odoo-addons-master-1=> ROLLBACK;
    ROLLBACK
    

In such a case, you can rollback to revert the unwanted changes that you just
mistakenly did, and rewrite the statement:

    
    
    odoo-addons-master-1=> BEGIN;
    BEGIN
    odoo-addons-master-1=> UPDATE res_users SET password = '***' WHERE id = 1;
    UPDATE 1
    odoo-addons-master-1=> COMMIT;
    COMMIT
    

However, do not forget to either commit or rollback your transaction after
having done it. Open transactions may lock records in your tables and your
running database may wait for them to be released. It can cause a server to
hang indefinitely.

In addition, when possible, use your staging databases to test your statements
first. It gives you an extra safety net.

## Run an Konvergo ERP server

You can start an Konvergo ERP server instance from a container shell. You won’t be
able to access it from the outside world with a browser, but you can for
instance:

  * use the Konvergo ERP shell,

    
    
    $  odoo-bin shell
    >>> partner = env['res.partner'].search([('email', '=', 'asusteK@yourcompany.example.com')], limit=1)
    >>> partner.name
    'ASUSTeK'
    >>> partner.name = 'Konvergo ERP'
    >>> env['res.partner'].search([('email', '=', 'asusteK@yourcompany.example.com')], limit=1).name
    'Konvergo ERP'
    

  * install a module,

    
    
    $  odoo-bin -i sale --without-demo=all --stop-after-init
    

  * update a module,

    
    
    $  odoo-bin -u sale --stop-after-init
    

  * run the tests for a module,

    
    
    $  odoo-bin -i sale --test-enable --log-level=test --stop-after-init
    

In the above commands, the argument:

  * `--without-demo=all` prevents demo data to be loaded for all modules

  * `--stop-after-init` will immediately shutdown the server instance after it completed the operations you asked.

More options are available and detailed in the [CLI
documentation](../../../developer/reference/cli).

You can find in the logs (_~/logs/odoo.log_) the addons path used by Konvergo ERP.sh
to run your server. Look for “ _odoo: addons paths_ ”:

    
    
    2018-02-19 10:51:39,267 4 INFO ? odoo: Konvergo ERP version 16.0
    2018-02-19 10:51:39,268 4 INFO ? odoo: Using configuration file at /home/odoo/.config/odoo/odoo.conf
    2018-02-19 10:51:39,268 4 INFO ? odoo: addons paths: ['/home/odoo/data/addons/16.0', '/home/odoo/src/user', '/home/odoo/src/enterprise', '/home/odoo/src/themes', '/home/odoo/src/odoo/addons', '/home/odoo/src/odoo/odoo/addons']
    

**Be careful** , especially with your production database. Operations that you
perform running this Konvergo ERP server instance are not isolated: Changes will be
effective in the database. Always, make your tests in your staging databases.

## Debugging in Konvergo ERP.sh

Debugging an Konvergo ERP.sh build is not really different than another Python app.
This article only explains the specificities and limitations of the Konvergo ERP.sh
platform, and assumes that you already know how to use a debugger.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>If you don’t know how to debug a Python application yet, there are multiple introductory courses that can be easily found on the Internet.</p>
</div>

You can use `pdb`, `pudb` or `ipdb` to debug your code on Konvergo ERP.sh. As the
server is run outside a shell, you cannot launch the debugger directly from
your Konvergo ERP instance backend as the debugger needs a shell to operate.

  * [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb) is installed by default in every container.

  * If you want to use [pudb](https://pypi.org/project/pudb/) or [ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/) you have to install it before.

To do so, you have two options:

>     * temporary (only in the current build):
>  
>         >         $  pip install pudb --user
>  
>
> or
>  
>         >         $  pip install ipdb --user
>  
>
>     * permanent: add `pudb` or `ipdb` to your project `requirements.txt`
> file.

Then edit the code where you want to trigger the debugger and add this:

    
    
    import sys
    if sys.__stdin__.isatty():
        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    

The condition `sys.__stdin__.isatty()` is a hack that detects if you run Konvergo ERP
from a shell.

Save the file and then run the Konvergo ERP Shell:

    
    
    $ odoo-bin shell
    

Finally, _via_ the Konvergo ERP Shell, you can trigger the piece of
code/function/method you want to debug.
