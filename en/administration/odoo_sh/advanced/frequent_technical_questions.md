# Frequent Technical Questions

## “Scheduled actions do not run at the exact time they were expected”

On the Konvergo ERP.sh platform, we cannot guarantee an exact running time for
scheduled actions.

This is due to the fact that there might be multiple customers on the same
server, and we must guarantee a fair share of the server for every customer.
Scheduled actions are therefore implemented slightly differently than on a
regular Konvergo ERP server, and are run on a _best effort_ policy.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>Do not expect any scheduled action to be run more often than every 5 min.</p>
</div>

## Are there “best practices” regarding scheduled actions?

**Konvergo ERP.sh always limits the execution time of scheduled actions (*aka*
crons).** Therefore, you must keep this fact in mind when developing your own
crons.

We advise that:

  * Your scheduled actions should work on small batches of records.

  * Your scheduled actions should commit their work after processing each batch; this way, if they get interrupted by the time-limit, there is no need to start over.

  * Your scheduled actions should be [idempotent](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1077421/3332416): they must not cause side-effects if they are started more often than expected.
