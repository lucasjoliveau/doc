# Settings

## Overview

The settings allow you to manage the configuration of your project.

![../../../_images/interface-settings.png](../../../_images/interface-
settings.png)

## Project name

The name of your project.

![../../../_images/interface-settings-
projectname.png](../../../_images/interface-settings-projectname.png)

This defines the address that will be used to access your production database.

Addresses of your staging and development builds are derived from this name
and assigned automatically. However, when you change your project name, only
future builds will use the new name.

## Collaborators

Manage the Github users who can access your project.

![../../../_images/interface-settings-
collaborators.png](../../../_images/interface-settings-collaborators.png)

There are two levels of users:

  * Admin: has access to all features of Konvergo ERP.sh.

  * User: does not have access to the project settings nor to the production and staging databases.

The user group is meant for developers who can make modifications in your code
but are not allowed to access the production data. Users of this group cannot
connect to the production and staging databases using the _1-click connect_
feature, but they can of course use their regular account on these databases
if they have one, using their regular credentials.

In addition, they cannot use the webshell nor have access to the server logs.

## Public Access

Allow public access to your development builds.

![../../../_images/interface-settings-public.png](../../../_images/interface-
settings-public.png)

If activated, this option exposes the Builds page publicly, allowing visitors
to connect to your development builds.

In addition, visitors have access to the logs, shell and mails of your
development builds.

Production and staging builds are excluded, visitors can only see their
status.

## Custom domains

To configure additional domains please refer to the corresponding branch’s
[settings tab](branches#odoosh-gettingstarted-branches-tabs-settings).

## Submodules

Configure the deploy keys for the private repositories you use as submodules
in your branches to allow Konvergo ERP.sh to download them.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>These settings are required for <b>private repositories</b> only. If you are looking on how to set
up your submodules, instructions are available in the chapter <a href="../advanced/submodules#odoosh-advanced-submodules"><span class="std std-ref">Submodules</span></a> of this documentation.</p>
</div> ![../../../_images/interface-settings-
submodules.png](../../../_images/interface-settings-submodules.png)

When a repository is private, it is not possible to publicly download its
branches and revisions. For that reason, you need to configure a deploy key
for Konvergo ERP.sh, so the remote Git server allows our platform to download the
revisions of this private repository.

To configure the deploy key for a private repository, proceed as follows:

  * in the input, paste the SSH URL of your private sub-repository and click on _Add_ ,

    * e.g. _git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git_

    * it can be another Git server than Github, such as Bitbucket, Gitlab or even your own self-hosted server

  * copy the public key,

    * it should look like _ssh-rsa some…random…characters…here…==_

  * in the settings of the private sub-repository, add the public key amongst the deploy keys.

    * Github.com: Settings ‣ Deploy keys ‣ Add deploy key

    * Bitbucket.com: Settings ‣ Access keys ‣ Add key

    * Gitlab.com: Settings ‣ Repository ‣ Deploy Keys

    * Self-hosted: append the key to the git user’s authorized_keys file in its .ssh directory

## Storage Size

This section shows the storage size used by your project.

![../../../_images/interface-settings-storage.png](../../../_images/interface-
settings-storage.png)

Storage size is computed as follows:

  * the size of the PostgreSQL database

  * the size of the disk files available in your container: database filestore, sessions storage directory…

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>In case you want to analyze disk usage, you can run the tool <a href="https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu/man">ncdu</a> in your Web Shell.</p>
</div>

Should your production database size grow to exceed what’s provisioned in your
subscription, it will automatically be synchronized with it.

## Database Workers

Additional database workers can be configured here. More workers help increase
the load your production database is able to handle. If you add more, it will
automatically be synchronized with your subscription.

![../../../_images/interface-settings-workers.png](../../../_images/interface-
settings-workers.png) <div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Warning</p><p>Adding more workers will not magically solve all performance issues. It only allows the server
to handle more connections at the same time. If some operations are unusually slow, it’s most
likely a problem with the code, if it’s not due to your own customizations you can open a ticket
<a href="https://www.odoo.com/help">here</a>.</p>
</div>

## Staging Branches

Additional staging branches allow you to develop and test more features at the
same time. If you add more, it will automatically be synchronized with your
subscription.

## Activation

Shows the status of the project’s activation. You can change the project’s
activation code if needed.
