# Supported versions

Odoo provides support and bug fixing **for the 3 last major versions** of
Odoo.

Note

Odoo releases intermediary versions called **Online versions** on the [Odoo
Online](odoo_online.html) hosting every two months. Odoo Online users can then
benefit from the latest features of Odoo.

  * Admins of Odoo Online databases are invited to [upgrade](upgrade.html) them regularly.

  * Online versions are _not_ released for Odoo.sh and On-Premise installations.

  * Online versions are listed below as _SaaS_.

This matrix shows the support status of every version.
