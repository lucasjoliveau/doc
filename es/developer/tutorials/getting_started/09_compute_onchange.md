# Chapter 9: Computed Fields And Onchanges

The [relations between models](08_relations#tutorials-getting-
started-08-relations) are a key component of any Konvergo ERP module. They are
necessary for the modelization of any business case. However, we may want
links between the fields within a given model. Sometimes the value of one
field is determined from the values of other fields and other times we want to
help the user with data entry.

These cases are supported by the concepts of computed fields and onchanges.
Although this chapter is not technically complex, the semantics of both
concepts is very important. This is also the first time we will write Python
logic. Until now we haven’t written anything other than class definitions and
field declarations.

## Computed Fields

**Reference** : the documentation related to this topic can be found in
[Computed Fields](../../reference/backend/orm#reference-fields-compute).

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Nota</p><p><b>Goal</b>: at the end of this section:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the property model, the total area and the best offer should be computed:</p></li>
</ul>
<img alt="Compute fields" class="align-center" src="../../../_images/compute.gif"/>
<ul>
<li><p>In the property offer model, the validity date should be computed and can be updated:</p></li>
</ul>
<img alt="Compute field with inverse" class="align-center" src="../../../_images/compute_inverse.gif"/>
</div>

In our real estate module, we have defined the living area as well as the
garden area. It is then natural to define the total area as the sum of both
fields. We will use the concept of a computed field for this, i.e. the value
of a given field will be computed from the value of other fields.

So far fields have been stored directly in and retrieved directly from the
database. Fields can also be _computed_. In this case, the field’s value is
not retrieved from the database but computed on-the-fly by calling a method of
the model.

To create a computed field, create a field and set its attribute `compute` to
the name of a method. The computation method should set the value of the
computed field for every record in `self`.

By convention, `compute` methods are private, meaning that they cannot be
called from the presentation tier, only from the business tier (see [Chapter
1: Architecture Overview](01_architecture#tutorials-getting-
started-01-architecture)). Private methods have a name starting with an
underscore `_`.

### Dependencies

The value of a computed field usually depends on the values of other fields in
the computed record. The ORM expects the developer to specify those
dependencies on the compute method with the decorator `depends()`. The given
dependencies are used by the ORM to trigger the recomputation of the field
whenever some of its dependencies have been modified:

    
    
    from odoo import api, fields, models
    
    class TestComputed(models.Model):
        _name = "test.computed"
    
        total = fields.Float(compute="_compute_total")
        amount = fields.Float()
    
        @api.depends("amount")
        def _compute_total(self):
            for record in self:
                record.total = 2.0 * record.amount
    

<div class="aphorism alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Nota</p><p><code>self</code> is a collection.</p>
<p>The object <code>self</code> is a <em>recordset</em>, i.e. an ordered collection of
records. It supports the standard Python operations on collections, e.g.
<code>len(self)</code> and <code>iter(self)</code>, plus extra set operations such as <code>recs1 |
recs2</code>.</p>
<p>Iterating over <code>self</code> gives the records one by one, where each record is
itself a collection of size 1. You can access/assign fields on single
records by using the dot notation, e.g. <code>record.name</code>.</p>
</div>

Many examples of computed fields can be found in Konvergo ERP.
[Here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/713dd3777ca0ce9d121d5162a3d63de3237509f4/addons/account/models/account_move.py#L3420-L3423)
is a simple one.

<div class="alert alert-dark">
<p class="alert-title">
Exercise</p><p>Compute the total area.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add the <code>total_area</code> field to <code>estate.property</code>. It is defined as the sum of the
<code>living_area</code> and the <code>garden_area</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the field in the form view as depicted on the first image of this section’s <b>Goal</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

For relational fields it’s possible to use paths through a field as a
dependency:

    
    
    description = fields.Char(compute="_compute_description")
    partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner")
    
    @api.depends("partner_id.name")
    def _compute_description(self):
        for record in self:
            record.description = "Test for partner %s" % record.partner_id.name
    

The example is given with a `Many2one`, but it is valid for `Many2many` or a
`One2many`. An example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/713dd3777ca0ce9d121d5162a3d63de3237509f4/addons/account/models/account_reconcile_model.py#L248-L251).

Let’s try it in our module with the following exercise!

<div class="alert alert-dark">
<p class="alert-title">
Exercise</p><p>Compute the best offer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add the <code>best_price</code> field to <code>estate.property</code>. It is defined as the highest (i.e. maximum) of the
offers” <code>price</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the field to the form view as depicted in the first image of this section’s <b>Goal</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: you might want to try using the <code>mapped()</code> method. See
<a href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/f011c9aacf3a3010c436d4e4f408cd9ae265de1b/addons/account/models/account_payment.py#L686">here</a>
for a simple example.</p>
</div>

### Inverse Function

You might have noticed that computed fields are read-only by default. This is
expected since the user is not supposed to set a value.

In some cases, it might be useful to still be able to set a value directly. In
our real estate example, we can define a validity duration for an offer and
set a validity date. We would like to be able to set either the duration or
the date with one impacting the other.

To support this Konvergo ERP provides the ability to use an `inverse` function:

    
    
    from odoo import api, fields, models
    
    class TestComputed(models.Model):
        _name = "test.computed"
    
        total = fields.Float(compute="_compute_total", inverse="_inverse_total")
        amount = fields.Float()
    
        @api.depends("amount")
        def _compute_total(self):
            for record in self:
                record.total = 2.0 * record.amount
    
        def _inverse_total(self):
            for record in self:
                record.amount = record.total / 2.0
    

An example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/2ccf0bd0dcb2e232ee894f07f24fdc26c51835f7/addons/crm/models/crm_lead.py#L308-L317).

A compute method sets the field while an inverse method sets the field’s
dependencies.

Note that the `inverse` method is called when saving the record, while the
`compute` method is called at each change of its dependencies.

<div class="alert alert-dark">
<p class="alert-title">
Exercise</p><p>Compute a validity date for offers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add the following fields to the <code>estate.property.offer</code> model:</p></li>
</ul>
<table class="table docutils">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%"/>
<col style="width: 33%"/>
<col style="width: 33%"/>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Field</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Type</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Default</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>validity</p></td>
<td><p>Integer</p></td>
<td><p>7</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>date_deadline</p></td>
<td><p>Date</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Where <code>date_deadline</code> is a computed field which is defined as the sum of two fields from
the offer: the <code>create_date</code> and the <code>validity</code>. Define an appropriate inverse function
so that the user can set either the date or the validity.</p>
<p>Tip: the <code>create_date</code> is only filled in when the record is created, therefore you will
need a fallback to prevent crashing at time of creation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add the fields in the form view and the list view as depicted on the second image of this section’s <b>Goal</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

### Additional Information

Computed fields are **not stored** in the database by default. Therefore it is
**not possible** to search on a computed field unless a `search` method is
defined. This topic is beyond the scope of this training, so we won’t cover
it. An example can be found
[here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/f011c9aacf3a3010c436d4e4f408cd9ae265de1b/addons/event/models/event_event.py#L188).

Another solution is to store the field with the `store=True` attribute. While
this is usually convenient, pay attention to the potential computation load
added to your model. Lets re-use our example:

    
    
    description = fields.Char(compute="_compute_description", store=True)
    partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner")
    
    @api.depends("partner_id.name")
    def _compute_description(self):
        for record in self:
            record.description = "Test for partner %s" % record.partner_id.name
    

Every time the partner `name` is changed, the `description` is automatically
recomputed for **all the records** referring to it! This can quickly become
prohibitive to recompute when millions of records need recomputation.

It is also worth noting that a computed field can depend on another computed
field. The ORM is smart enough to correctly recompute all the dependencies in
the right order… but sometimes at the cost of degraded performance.

In general performance must always be kept in mind when defining computed
fields. The more complex is your field to compute (e.g. with a lot of
dependencies or when a computed field depends on other computed fields), the
more time it will take to compute. Always take some time to evaluate the cost
of a computed field beforehand. Most of the time it is only when your code
reaches a production server that you realize it slows down a whole process.
Not cool :-(

## Onchanges

**Reference** : the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`onchange()`:

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Nota</p><p><b>Goal</b>: at the end of this section, enabling the garden will set a default area of 10 and
an orientation to North.</p>
<img alt="Onchange" class="align-center" src="../../../_images/onchange.gif"/>
</div>

In our real estate module, we also want to help the user with data entry. When
the “garden” field is set, we want to give a default value for the garden area
as well as the orientation. Additionally, when the “garden” field is unset we
want the garden area to reset to zero and the orientation to be removed. In
this case, the value of a given field modifies the value of other fields.

The “onchange” mechanism provides a way for the client interface to update a
form without saving anything to the database whenever the user has filled in a
field value. To achieve this, we define a method where `self` represents the
record in the form view and decorate it with `onchange()` to specify which
field it is triggered by. Any change you make on `self` will be reflected on
the form:

    
    
    from odoo import api, fields, models
    
    class TestOnchange(models.Model):
        _name = "test.onchange"
    
        name = fields.Char(string="Name")
        description = fields.Char(string="Description")
        partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")
    
        @api.onchange("partner_id")
        def _onchange_partner_id(self):
            self.name = "Document for %s" % (self.partner_id.name)
            self.description = "Default description for %s" % (self.partner_id.name)
    

In this example, changing the partner will also change the name and the
description values. It is up to the user whether or not to change the name and
description values afterwards. Also note that we do not loop on `self`, this
is because the method is only triggered in a form view, where `self` is always
a single record.

<div class="alert alert-dark">
<p class="alert-title">
Exercise</p><p>Set values for garden area and orientation.</p>
<p>Create an <code>onchange</code> in the <code>estate.property</code> model in order to set values for the
garden area (10) and orientation (North) when garden is set to True. When unset, clear the fields.</p>
</div>

### Additional Information

Onchanges methods can also return a non-blocking warning message
([example](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/cd9af815ba591935cda367d33a1d090f248dd18d/addons/payment_authorize/models/payment.py#L34-L36)).

## How to use them?

There is no strict rule for the use of computed fields and onchanges.

In many cases, both computed fields and onchanges may be used to achieve the
same result. Always prefer computed fields since they are also triggered
outside of the context of a form view. Never ever use an onchange to add
business logic to your model. This is a **very bad** idea since onchanges are
not automatically triggered when creating a record programmatically; they are
only triggered in the form view.

The usual pitfall of computed fields and onchanges is trying to be “too smart”
by adding too much logic. This can have the opposite result of what was
expected: the end user is confused from all the automation.

Computed fields tend to be easier to debug: such a field is set by a given
method, so it’s easy to track when the value is set. Onchanges, on the other
hand, may be confusing: it is very difficult to know the extent of an
onchange. Since several onchange methods may set the same fields, it easily
becomes difficult to track where a value is coming from.

When using stored computed fields, pay close attention to the dependencies.
When computed fields depend on other computed fields, changing a value can
trigger a large number of recomputations. This leads to poor performance.

In the [next chapter](10_actions#tutorials-getting-started-10-actions),
we’ll see how we can trigger some business logic when buttons are clicked.
