Welcome to the Getting Started Konvergo ERP tutorial! If you reached this page that
means you are interested in the development of your own Konvergo ERP module. It might
also mean that you recently joined the Konvergo ERP company for a rather technical
position. In any case, your journey to the technical side of Konvergo ERP starts here.

The goal of this tutorial is for you to get an insight of the most important
parts of the Konvergo ERP development framework while developing your own Konvergo ERP module
to manage real estate assets. The chapters should be followed in their given
order since they cover the development of a new Konvergo ERP application from scratch
in an incremental way. In other words, each chapter depends on the previous
one.
