# Odoo Editor

Odoo Editor is Odoo’s own rich text editor. Its sources can be found in the
[odoo-editor
directory](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/16.0/addons/web_editor/static/src/js/editor/odoo-
editor).

## Powerbox

The Powerbox is a piece of user interface that contains commands organized
into categories. It appears when typing `/` in the editor. The commands can be
filtered when the user inputs text, and navigated with the arrow keys.

### Modifying the Powerbox

Only one Powerbox should be instantiated at the time, and that job is done by
the editor itself. Its Powerbox instance can be found in its `powerbox`
instance variable. To change the Powerbox’s contents and options, change the
options passed to the editor before it gets instantiated.

Importante

Never instantiate the Powerbox yourself. Always use the current editor’s own
instance instead.

Example

Say we want to add a new command `Document` to the Powerbox, just for the
`mass_mailing` module. We want to add it to a new category called
`Documentation` and we want it all the way at the top of the Powerbox.

`mass_mailing`
[extends](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/16.0/addons/mass_mailing/static/src/js/wysiwyg.js)
`web_editor`’s [Wysiwyg
class](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/16.0/addons/web_editor/static/src/js/wysiwyg/wysiwyg.js),
which instantiates the editor in its `start` method. Before doing so, it calls
its own `_getPowerboxOptions` method, which can conveniently be overridden to
add our new commands.

Since `mass_mailing` already overrides `_getPowerboxOptions`, let’s just add
our new command to it:

    
    
    _getPowerboxOptions: function () {
        const options = this._super();
        // (existing code before the return statement)
        options.categories.push({
            name: _t('Documentation'),
            priority: 300,
        });
        options.commands.push({
            name: _t('Document'),
            category: _t('Documentation'),
            description: _t("Add this text to your mailing's documentation"),
            fontawesome: 'fa-book',
            priority: 1, // This is the only command in its category anyway.
        });
        return options;
    }
    

Importante

In order to allow the names and descriptions of your commands and categories
to be translated, make sure to wrap them in the `_t` function.

Truco

To avoid out-of-control escalations, don’t use random numbers for your
priorities: look at which other priorities already exist and choose your value
accordingly (like you would do for a `z-index`).

### Opening a custom Powerbox

It is possible to open the Powerbox with a custom set of categories and
commands, bypassing all pre-existing ones. To do that, call the `open` method
of the Powerbox and pass it your custom commands and categories.

![The Powerbox opened with custom categories and commands when pasting an
image URL.](../../../_images/powerbox-custom.png)

Example

We need the current instance of the Powerbox, which can be found in the
current editor. In the [Wysiwyg
class](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/16.0/addons/web_editor/static/src/js/wysiwyg/wysiwyg.js),
you will find it as `this.odooEditor.powerbox`.

Now to open it with our custom «Document» command in a custom «Documentation»
category:

    
    
    this.odooEditor.powerbox.open(
        [{
            name: _t('Document'),
            category: _t('Documentation'),
            description: _t("Add this text to your mailing's documentation"),
            fontawesome: 'fa-book',
            priority: 1, // This is the only command in its category anyway.
        }],
        [{
            name: _t('Documentation'),
            priority: 300,
        }]
    );
    

### Filtering commands

There are three ways to filter commands:

  1. Via the `powerboxFilters` Powerbox option.

  2. Via a given command’s `isDisabled` entry.

  3. The user can filter commands by simply typing text after opening the Powerbox. It will fuzzy-match that text with the names of the categories and commands.

![The Powerbox with its commands filtered using the word
"head".](../../../_images/powerbox-filtered.png)

### Reference

#### Category

Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`name` | `string` | the name of the category  
`priority` | `number` | used to order the category: a category with a higher priority is displayed higher into the Powerbox (categories with the same priority are ordered alphabetically)  
  
Nota

If several categories exist with the same name, they will be grouped into one.
Its priority will be that defined in the version of the category that was
declared last.

#### Command

Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`name` | `string` | the name of the command  
`category` | `string` | the name of the category the command belongs to  
`description` | `string` | a short text to describe the command  
`fontawesome` | `string` | the name of a _Font Awesome_ that will serve as the command’s icon  
`priority` | `number` | used to order the command: a command with a higher priority is displayed higher into the Powerbox (commands with the same priority are ordered alphabetically)  
`callback` | `function` (`() => void`) | the function to execute when the command is picked (can be asynchronous)  
`isDisabled` (optional) | `function` (`() => void`) | a function used to disable the command under certain conditions (when it returns `true`, the command will be disabled)  
  
Nota

If the command points to a category that doesn’t exist yet, that category will
be created and appended at the end of the Powerbox.

#### Options

The following options can be passed to OdooEditor, that will then be passed to
the instance of the Powerbox:

Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`commands` | `array of commands` | commands to add to the default defined by the editor  
`categories` | `array of categories` | categories to add to the default defined by the editor  
`powerboxFilters` | `array of functions` (`commands => commands`) | functions used to filter commands displayed in the Powerbox  
`getContextFromParentRect` | `function` (`() => DOMRect`) | a function that returns the `DOMRect` of an ancestor of the editor (can be useful when the editor is in an iframe)
