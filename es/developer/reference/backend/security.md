# Security in Konvergo ERP

Aside from manually managing access using custom code, Konvergo ERP provides two main
data-driven mechanisms to manage or restrict access to data.

Both mechanisms are linked to specific users through _groups_ : a user belongs
to any number of groups, and security mechanisms are associated to groups,
thus applying security mechanisms to users.

_class _res.groups

    

name

    

serves as user-readable identification for the group (spells out the role /
purpose of the group)

category_id

    

The _module category_ , serves to associate groups with an Konvergo ERP App (~a set of
related business models) and convert them into an exclusive selection in the
user form.

implied_ids

    

Other groups to set on the user alongside this one. This is a convenience
pseudo-inheritance relationship: it’s possible to explicitly remove implied
groups from a user without removing the implier.

Additional notes on the group e.g.

## Access Rights

_Grants_ access to an entire model for a given set of operations. If no access
rights matches an operation on a model for a user (through their group), the
user doesn’t have access.

Access rights are additive, a user’s accesses are the union of the accesses
they get through all their groups e.g. given a user who is part of group A
granting read and create access and a group B granting update access, the user
will have all three of create, read, and update.

_class _ir.model.access

    

name

    

The purpose or role of the group.

model_id

    

The model whose access the ACL controls.

group_id

    

The `res.groups` to which the accesses are granted, an empty `group_id` means
the ACL is granted to _every user_ (non-employees e.g. portal or public
users).

The `perm__method_` attributes grant the corresponding CRUD access when set,
they are all unset by default.

perm_create

    

perm_read

    

perm_write

    

perm_unlink

    

## Record Rules

Record rules are _conditions_ which must be satisfied in order for an
operation to be allowed. Record rules are evaluated record-by-record,
following access rights.

Record rules are default-allow: if access rights grant access and no rule
applies to the operation and model for the user, the access is granted.

_class _ir.rule

    

name

    

The description of the rule.

model_id

    

The model to which the rule applies.

groups

    

The `res.groups` to which access is granted (or not). Multiple groups can be
specified. If no group is specified, the rule is _global_ which is treated
differently than «group» rules (see below).

global

    

Computed on the basis of `groups`, provides easy access to the global status
(or not) of the rule.

domain_force

    

A predicate specified as a [domain](orm#reference-orm-domains), the rule
allows the selected operations if the domain matches the record, and forbids
it otherwise.

The domain is a _python expression_ which can use the following variables:

`time`

    

Python’s [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time#module-time
"\(en Python versión 3.12\)") module.

`user`

    

The current user, as a singleton recordset.

`company_id`

    

The current user’s currently selected company as a single company id (not a
recordset).

`company_ids`

    

All the companies to which the current user has access as a list of company
ids (not a recordset), see [Security rules](../../howtos/company#howto-
company-security) for more details.

The `perm__method_` have completely different semantics than for
`ir.model.access`: for rules, they specify which operation the rules applies
_for_. If an operation is not selected, then the rule is not checked for it,
as if the rule did not exist.

All operations are selected by default.

perm_create

    

perm_read

    

perm_write

    

perm_unlink

    

### Global rules versus group rules

There is a large difference between global and group rules in how they compose
and combine:

  * Global rules _intersect_ , if two global rules apply then _both_ must be satisfied for the access to be granted, this means adding global rules always restricts access further.

  * Group rules _unify_ , if two group rules apply then _either_ can be satisfied for the access to be granted. This means adding group rules can expand access, but not beyond the bounds defined by global rules.

  * The global and group rulesets _intersect_ , which means the first group rule being added to a given global ruleset will restrict access.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<p class="alert-title">
Peligro</p><p>Creating multiple global rules is risky as it’s possible to create
non-overlapping rulesets, which will remove all access.</p>
</div>

## Field Access

An ORM `Field` can have a `groups` attribute providing a list of groups (as a
comma-separated string of [external identifiers](../../glossary#term-
external-identifiers)).

If the current user is not in one of the listed groups, he will not have
access to the field:

  * restricted fields are automatically removed from requested views

  * restricted fields are removed from `fields_get()` responses

  * attempts to (explicitly) read from or write to restricted fields results in an access error

## Security Pitfalls

As a developer, it is important to understand the security mechanisms and
avoid common mistakes leading to insecure code.

### Unsafe Public Methods

Any public method can be executed via a [RPC call](../external_api#api-
external-api-calling-methods) with the chosen parameters. The methods starting
with a `_` are not callable from an action button or external API.

On public methods, the record on which a method is executed and the parameters
can not be trusted, ACL being only verified during CRUD operations.

    
    
    # this method is public and its arguments can not be trusted
    def action_done(self):
        if self.state == "draft" and self.user_has_groups('base.manager'):
            self._set_state("done")
    
    # this method is private and can only be called from other python methods
    def _set_state(self, new_state):
        self.sudo().write({"state": new_state})
    

Making a method private is obviously not enough and care must be taken to use
it properly.

### Bypassing the ORM

You should never use the database cursor directly when the ORM can do the same
thing! By doing so you are bypassing all the ORM features, possibly the
automated behaviours like translations, invalidation of fields, `active`,
access rights and so on.

And chances are that you are also making the code harder to read and probably
less secure.

    
    
    # very very wrong
    self.env.cr.execute('SELECT id FROM auction_lots WHERE auction_id in (' + ','.join(map(str, ids))+') AND state=%s AND obj_price > 0', ('draft',))
    auction_lots_ids = [x[0] for x in self.env.cr.fetchall()]
    
    # no injection, but still wrong
    self.env.cr.execute('SELECT id FROM auction_lots WHERE auction_id in %s '\
               'AND state=%s AND obj_price > 0', (tuple(ids), 'draft',))
    auction_lots_ids = [x[0] for x in self.env.cr.fetchall()]
    
    # better
    auction_lots_ids = self.search([('auction_id','in',ids), ('state','=','draft'), ('obj_price','>',0)])
    

#### SQL injections

Care must be taken not to introduce SQL injections vulnerabilities when using
manual SQL queries. The vulnerability is present when user input is either
incorrectly filtered or badly quoted, allowing an attacker to introduce
undesirable clauses to a SQL query (such as circumventing filters or executing
`UPDATE` or `DELETE` commands).

The best way to be safe is to never, NEVER use Python string concatenation (+)
or string parameters interpolation (%) to pass variables to a SQL query
string.

The second reason, which is almost as important, is that it is the job of the
database abstraction layer (psycopg2) to decide how to format query
parameters, not your job! For example psycopg2 knows that when you pass a list
of values it needs to format them as a comma-separated list, enclosed in
parentheses !

    
    
    # the following is very bad:
    #   - it's a SQL injection vulnerability
    #   - it's unreadable
    #   - it's not your job to format the list of ids
    self.env.cr.execute('SELECT distinct child_id FROM account_account_consol_rel ' +
               'WHERE parent_id IN ('+','.join(map(str, ids))+')')
    
    # better
    self.env.cr.execute('SELECT DISTINCT child_id '\
               'FROM account_account_consol_rel '\
               'WHERE parent_id IN %s',
               (tuple(ids),))
    

This is very important, so please be careful also when refactoring, and most
importantly do not copy these patterns!

Here is a memorable example to help you remember what the issue is about (but
do not copy the code there). Before continuing, please be sure to read the
online documentation of pyscopg2 to learn of to use it properly:

  * [The problem with query parameters](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage#the-problem-with-the-query-parameters)

  * [How to pass parameters with psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage#passing-parameters-to-sql-queries)

  * [Advanced parameter types](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage#adaptation-of-python-values-to-sql-types)

  * [Psycopg documentation](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/sql)

### Unescaped field content

When rendering content using JavaScript and XML, one may be tempted to use a
`t-raw` to display rich-text content. This should be avoided as a frequent
[XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vector.

It is very hard to control the integrity of the data from the computation
until the final integration in the browser DOM. A `t-raw` that is correctly
escaped at the time of introduction may no longer be safe at the next bugfix
or refactoring.

    
    
    QWeb.render('insecure_template', {
        info_message: "You have an <strong>important</strong> notification",
    })
    
    
    
    <div t-name="insecure_template">
        <div id="information-bar"><t t-raw="info_message" /></div>
    </div>
    

The above code may feel safe as the message content is controlled but is a bad
practice that may lead to unexpected security vulnerabilities once this code
evolves in the future.

    
    
    // XSS possible with unescaped user provided content !
    QWeb.render('insecure_template', {
        info_message: "You have an <strong>important</strong> notification on " \
            + "the product <strong>" + product.name + "</strong>",
    })
    

While formatting the template differently would prevent such vulnerabilities.

    
    
    QWeb.render('secure_template', {
        message: "You have an important notification on the product:",
        subject: product.name
    })
    
    
    
    <div t-name="secure_template">
        <div id="information-bar">
            <div class="info"><t t-esc="message" /></div>
            <div class="subject"><t t-esc="subject" /></div>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    
    
    .subject {
        font-weight: bold;
    }
    

### Escaping vs Sanitizing

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Importante</p><p>Escaping is always 100% mandatory when you mix data and code, no matter how
safe the data</p>
</div>

**Escaping** converts _TEXT_ to _CODE_. It is absolutely mandatory to do it
every time you mix _DATA/TEXT_ with _CODE_ (e.g. generating HTML or python
code to be evaluated inside a `safe_eval`), because _CODE_ always requires
_TEXT_ to be encoded. It is critical for security, but it’s also a question of
correctness. Even when there is no security risk (because the text is 100%
guarantee to be safe or trusted), it is still required (e.g. to avoid breaking
the layout in generated HTML).

Escaping will never break any feature, as long as the developer identifies
which variable contains _TEXT_ and which contains _CODE_.

    
    
    >>> from odoo.tools import html_escape, html_sanitize
    >>> data = "<R&D>" # `data` is some TEXT coming from somewhere
    
    # Escaping turns it into CODE, good!
    >>> code = html_escape(data)
    >>> code
    '&lt;R&amp;D&gt;'
    
    # Now you can mix it with other code...
    >>> self.message_post(body="<strong>%s</strong>" % code)
    

**Sanitizing** converts _CODE_ to _SAFER CODE_ (but not necessary _safe_
code). It does not work on _TEXT_. Sanitizing is only necessary when _CODE_ is
untrusted, because it comes in full or in part from some user-provided data.
If the user-provided data is in the form of _TEXT_ (e.g. the content from a
form filled by a user), and if that data was correctly escaped before putting
it in _CODE_ , then sanitizing is useless (but can still be done). If however,
the user-provided data was **not escaped** , then sanitizing will **not** work
as expected.

    
    
    # Sanitizing without escaping is BROKEN: data is corrupted!
    >>> html_sanitize(data)
    ''
    
    # Sanitizing *after* escaping is OK!
    >>> html_sanitize(code)
    '<p>&lt;R&amp;D&gt;</p>'
    

Sanitizing can break features, depending on whether the _CODE_ is expected to
contain patterns that are not safe. That’s why `fields.Html` and
`tools.html_sanitize()` have options to fine-tune the level of sanitization
for styles, etc. Those options have to be carefully considered depending on
where the data comes from, and the desired features. The sanitization safety
is balanced against sanitization breakages: the safer the sanitisation the
more likely it is to break things.

    
    
    >>code = "<p class='text-warning'>Important Information</p>"
    # this will remove the style, which may break features
    # but is necessary if the source is untrusted
    >> html_sanitize(code, strip_classes=True)
    '<p>Important Information</p>'
    

### Evaluating content

Some may want to `eval` to parse user provided content. Using `eval` should be
avoided at all cost. A safer, sandboxed, method `safe_eval` can be used
instead but still gives tremendous capabilities to the user running it and
must be reserved for trusted privileged users only as it breaks the barrier
between code and data.

    
    
    # very bad
    domain = eval(self.filter_domain)
    return self.search(domain)
    
    # better but still not recommended
    from odoo.tools import safe_eval
    domain = safe_eval(self.filter_domain)
    return self.search(domain)
    
    # good
    from ast import literal_eval
    domain = literal_eval(self.filter_domain)
    return self.search(domain)
    

Parsing content does not need `eval`

Language | Data type | Suitable parser  
---|---|---  
Python | int, float, etc. | int(), float()  
Javascript | int, float, etc. | parseInt(), parseFloat()  
Python | dict | json.loads(), ast.literal_eval()  
Javascript | object, list, etc. | JSON.parse()  
  
### Accessing object attributes

If the values of a record needs to be retrieved or modified dynamically, one
may want to use the `getattr` and `setattr` methods.

    
    
    # unsafe retrieval of a field value
    def _get_state_value(self, res_id, state_field):
        record = self.sudo().browse(res_id)
        return getattr(record, state_field, False)
    

This code is however not safe as it allows to access any property of the
record, including private attributes or methods.

The `__getitem__` of a recordset has been defined and accessing a dynamic
field value can be easily achieved safely:

    
    
    # better retrieval of a field value
    def _get_state_value(self, res_id, state_field):
        record = self.sudo().browse(res_id)
        return record[state_field]
    

The above method is obviously still too optimistic and additional
verifications on the record id and field value must be done.
