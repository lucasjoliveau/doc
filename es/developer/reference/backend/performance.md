# Performance

## Profiling

Profiling is about analysing the execution of a program and measure aggregated
data. These data can be the elapsed time for each function, the executed SQL
queries…

While profiling does not improve the performance of a program by itself, it
can prove very helpful in finding performance issues and identifying which
part of the program is responsible for them.

Konvergo ERP provides an integrated profiling tool that allows recording all executed
queries and stack traces during execution. It can be used to profile either a
set of requests of a user session, or a specific portion of code. Profiling
results can be either inspected with the integrated
[speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope) open source app allowing
to visualize a flamegraph view or analyzed with custom tools by first saving
them in a JSON file or in the database.

### Enable the profiler

The profiler can either be enabled from the user interface, which is the
easiest way to do so but allows profiling only web requests, or from Python
code, which allows profiling any piece of code including tests.

Enable from the user interfaceEnable from Python code

  1. [Enable the developer mode](../../../applications/general/developer_mode#developer-mode).

  2. Before starting a profiling session, the profiler must be enabled globally on the database. This can be done in two ways:

     * Open the [developer mode tools](../../../applications/general/developer_mode#developer-mode-tools), then toggle the **Enable profiling** button. A wizard suggests a set of expiry times for the profiling. Click on **ENABLE PROFILING** to enable the profiler globally.

![../../../_images/enable_profiling_wizard.png](../../../_images/enable_profiling_wizard.png)

     * Go to **Settings – > General Settings –> Performance** and set the desired time to the field **Enable profiling until**.

  3. After the profiler is enabled on the database, users can enable it on their session. To do so, toggle the **Enable profiling** button in the [developer mode tools](../../../applications/general/developer_mode#developer-mode-tools) again. By default, the recommended options **Record sql** and **Record traces** are enabled. To learn more about the different options, head over to Collectors.

When the profiler is enabled, all the requests made to the server are profiled
and saved into an `ir.profile` record. Such records are grouped into the
current profiling session which spans from when the profiler was enabled until
it is disabled.

</div>

Starting the profiler manually can be convenient to profile a specific method
or a part of the code. This code can be a test, a compute method, the entire
loading, etc.

To start the profiler from Python code, call it as a context manager. You may
specify _what_ you want to record through the parameters. A shortcut is
available for profiling test classes: `self.profile()`. See Collectors for
more information on the `collectors` parameter.

When the profiler is enabled, all executions of a test method are profiled and
saved into an `ir.profile` record. Such records are grouped into a single
profiling session. This is especially useful when using the `@warmup` and
`@users` decorators.

### Analyse the results

To browse the profiling results, make sure that the profiler is enabled
globally on the database, then open the [developer mode
tools](../../../applications/general/developer_mode#developer-mode-tools)
and click on the button in the top-right corner of the profiling section. A
list view of the `ir.profile` records grouped by profiling session opens.

![../../../_images/profiling_web.png](../../../_images/profiling_web.png)

Each record has a clickable link that opens the speedscope results in a new
tab.

![../../../_images/flamegraph_example.png](../../../_images/flamegraph_example.png)

Speedscope falls out of the scope of this documentation but there are a lot of
tools to try: search, highlight of similar frames, zoom on frame, timeline,
left heavy, sandwich view…

Depending on the profiling options that were activated, Konvergo ERP generates
different view modes that you can access from the top menu.

![../../../_images/speedscope_modes.png](../../../_images/speedscope_modes.png)

  * The **Combined** view shows all the SQL queries and traces merged togethers.

  * The **Combined no context** view shows the same result but ignores the saved execution context <performance/profiling/enable>`.

  * The **sql (no gap)** view shows all the SQL queries as if they were executed one after another, without any Python logic. This is useful for optimizing SQL only.

  * The **sql (density)** view shows only all the SQL queries, leaving gap between them. This can be useful to spot if eiter SQL or Python code is the problem, and to identify zones in where many small queries could be batched.

  * The **frames** view shows the results of only the periodic collector.

</div>

### Collectors

Whereas the profiler is about the _when_ of profiling, the collectors take
care of the _what_.

Each collector specializes in collecting profiling data in its own format and
manner. They can be individually enabled from the user interface through their
dedicated toggle button in the [developer mode
tools](../../../applications/general/developer_mode#developer-mode-
tools), or from Python code through their key or class.

There are currently four collectors available in Konvergo ERP:

Name | Toggle button | Python key | Python class  
---|---|---|---  
SQL collector | **Record sql** | `sql` | `SqlCollector`  
Periodic collector | **Record traces** | `traces_async` | `PeriodicCollector`  
QWeb collector | **Record qweb** | `qweb` | `QwebCollector`  
Sync collector | No | `traces_sync` | `SyncCollector`  
  
By default, the profiler enables the SQL and the Periodic collectors. Both
when it is enabled from the user interface or Python code.

#### SQL collector

The SQL collector saves all the SQL queries made to the database in the
current thread (for all cursors), as well as the stack trace. The overhead of
the collector is added to the analysed thread for each query, which means that
using it on a lot of small queries may impact execution time and other
profilers.

It is especially useful to debug query counts, or to add information to the
Periodic collector in the combined speedscope view.

#### Periodic collector

This collector runs in a separate thread and saves the stack trace of the
analysed thread at every interval. The interval (by default 10 ms) can be
defined through the **Interval** option in the user interface, or the
`interval` parameter in Python code.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Advertencia</p><p>If the interval is set at a very low value, profiling long requests will generate memory issues.
If the interval is set at a very high value, information on short function executions will be
lost.</p>
</div>

It is one of the best way to analyse performance as it should have a very low
impact on the execution time thanks to its separate thread.

#### QWeb collector

This collector saves the Python execution time and queries of all directives.
As for the SQL collector, the overhead can be important when executing a lot
of small directives. The results are different from other collectors in terms
of collected data, and can be analysed from the `ir.profile` form view using a
custom widget.

It is mainly useful for optimizing views.

#### Sync collector

This collector saves the stack for every function’s call and return and runs
on the same thread, which greatly impacts performance.

It can be useful to debug and understand complex flows, and follow their
execution in the code. It is however not recommended for performance analysis
because the overhead is high.

### Performance pitfalls

  * Be careful with randomness. Multiple executions may lead to different results. E.g., a garbage collector being triggered during execution.

  * Be careful with blocking calls. In some cases, external `c_call` may take some time before releasing the GIL, thus leading to unexpected long frames with the Periodic collector. This should be detected by the profiler and give a warning. It is possible to trigger the profiler manually before such calls if needed.

  * Pay attention to the cache. Profiling before that the `view`/`assets`/… are in cache can lead to different results.

  * Be aware of the profiler’s overhead. The SQL collector’s overhead can be important when a lot of small queries are executed. Profiling is practical to spot a problem but you may want to disable the profiler in order to measure the real impact of a code change.

  * Profiling results can be memory intensive. In some cases (e.g., profiling an install or a long request), it is possible that you reach memory limit, especially when rendering the speedscope results, which can lead to an HTTP 500 error. In this case, you may need to start the server with a higher memory limit: `--limit-memory-hard $((8*1024**3))`.

## Database population

Konvergo ERP CLI offers a [database population](../cli#reference-cmdline-
populate) feature through the CLI command **odoo-bin populate**.

Instead of the tedious manual, or programmatic, specification of test data,
one can use this feature to fill a database on demand with the desired number
of test data. This can be used to detect diverse bugs or performance issues in
tested flows.

To populate a given model, the following methods and attributes can be
defined.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Nota</p><p>You have to define at least <code>_populate()</code> or
<code>_populate_factories()</code> on the model to enable database population.</p>
</div> <div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">Profiler</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">do_stuff</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

### Population tools

Multiple population tools are available to easily create the needed data
generators.

## Good practices

### Batch operations

When working with recordsets, it is almost always better to batch operations.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">Profiler</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">do_stuff</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>1 <div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">Profiler</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">do_stuff</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>3 <div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">Profiler</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">do_stuff</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

### Reduce the algorithmic complexity

Algorithmic complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm would take to
complete in regard to the size `n` of the input. When the complexity is high,
the execution time can grow quickly as the input becomes larger. In some
cases, the algorithmic complexity can be reduced by preparing the input’s data
correctly.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">Profiler</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">do_stuff</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>5 <div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">Profiler</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">do_stuff</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>6

### Use indexes

Database indexes can help fasten search operations, be it from a search in the
or through the user interface.

    
    
    name = fields.Char(string="Name", index=True)
    

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">Profiler</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">do_stuff</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
