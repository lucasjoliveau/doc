# Chapter 16: The final word

## Coding guidelines

We will start refactoring the code to match to the Konvergo ERP coding guidelines. The
guidelines aim to improve the quality of the Konvergo ERP Apps code.

**Reference** : you will find the Konvergo ERP coding guidelines in [Coding
guidelines](../../../contributing/development/coding_guidelines).

<p>Refactor your code to respect the coding guidelines. Donâ€™t forget to run your linter and
respect the module structure, the variable names, the method name convention, the model
attribute order and the xml ids.</p>

## Test on the runbot

Konvergo ERP has its own CI server named [runbot](https://runbot.odoo.com/). All
commits, branches and PR will be tested to avoid regressions or breaking of
the stable versions. All the runs that pass the tests are deployed on their
own server with demo data.

applications and functionalities.</p>
