Welcome to the Getting Started Odoo tutorial! If you reached this page that
means you are interested in the development of your own Odoo module. It might
also mean that you recently joined the Odoo company for a rather technical
position. In any case, your journey to the technical side of Odoo starts here.

The goal of this tutorial is for you to get an insight of the most important
parts of the Odoo development framework while developing your own Odoo module
to manage real estate assets. The chapters should be followed in their given
order since they cover the development of a new Odoo application from scratch
in an incremental way. In other words, each chapter depends on the previous
one.

Attention

Are you following this tutorial as part of your technical onboarding as an
Odoo employee? Then, we ask you to complete all the chapters before joining
your new team.
