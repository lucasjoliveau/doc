  * [Chapter 2: Konvergo ERP Web Framework](discover_js_framework/02_web_framework)

This tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of the Konvergo ERP
Javascript framework. Whether you are new to the framework or have some prior
experience, this tutorial will provide you with a solid foundation for using
the Konvergo ERP JavaScript framework in your projects.

This tutorial is divided into two parts. The first part covers the basics of
Owl components, which are a key part of the Konvergo ERP JS framework. Owl components
are reusable UI components that can be used to build complex web interfaces
quickly and efficiently. We will explore how to create and use Owl components
in Konvergo ERP.

The second part of the tutorial focuses on creating a dashboard using various
features of Konvergo ERP. Dashboards are an essential part of any web application, and
provide a nice starting point to use and interact with the Konvergo ERP codebase.

This tutorial assumes that you have some basic knowledge of development with
Konvergo ERP in general (models, controllers, QWeb, â€¦). If you are new to Konvergo ERP, we
recommend that you start with the [Getting started](getting_started)
tutorial before proceeding with this one.
