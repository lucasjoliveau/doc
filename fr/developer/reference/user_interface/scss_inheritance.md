# SCSS inheritance

## Overview

Managing SCSS assets in Odoo is not as straightforward as it is in some other
environments, but it’s highly efficient.

Modularity is key. The inheritance scheme described further allows Odoo to:

  * customize the Bootstrap CSS framework;

  * handle two different webclient designs (Community and Enterprise);

  * handle backend and frontend bundles separately (including the user’s website design);

  * contextually load only necessary assets;

  * handle multiple color-schemes (e.g.: dark-mode);

## SCSS’s `!default` directive

« Direct variables’ overrides » are technically possible in SCSS but may lead
to inconsistent results in complex environments like Odoo.

Example

`library.scss`

    
    
    $foo: red;
    

`customization_layer.scss`

    
    
    $foo: blue; // -> Don't!
    

Indeed, since the compilation process acts across different interdependent
bundles, re-assigning a variable in the « wrong spot » may lead to unexpected
cascading results.

SCSS provides several techniques to overcome these issues (e.g.:
[shadowing](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables#shadowing)), but the
most critical procedure in Odoo is the use of the `!default` flag.

When using the `!default` flag, the compiler assigns a value **only** if that
variable is not yet defined.

As a result of this technique, the priority in which variables are assigned
matches the assets” loading order.

Example

`customization_layer.scss`

    
    
    $foo: red !default;
    

`library.scss`

    
    
    $foo: blue !default; // -> Already defined, line ignored.
    $bar: black !default; // -> Not defined yet, value assigned.
    

`component.scss`

    
    
    .component {
       color: $foo; // -> 'color: red;'
       background: $bar; // -> 'background: black;'
    }

## Odoo’s SCSS inheritance system

The following diagram conceptually illustrates the compilation order in which
the CSS and SCSS variables are defined.

    
    
    ↓ [Compilation starts]
    ⏐
    ↓ web.dark_mode_variables
    ⏐   ├─ Primary Variables
    ⏐   └─ Components Variables
    ⏐
    ↓ web._assets_primary_variables
    ⏐   ├─ Primary Variables (enterprise)
    ⏐   ├─ Components Variables (enterprise)
    ⏐   ├─ Primary Variables (community)
    ⏐   └─ Components Variables (community)
    ⏐
    ↓ web._assets_bootstrap
    ⏐
    ↓ web.assets_backend
    ⏐   ├─ ...
    ⏐   ├─ CSS variables definition
