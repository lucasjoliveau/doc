# Write lean easy-to-maintain CSS

There are many ways to lean and simplify SCSS. The first step is to establish
if custom code is needed at all.

Odoo’s webclient has been designed to be modular, meaning that (potentially
all) classes can be shared across views. Check the code before creating a new
class. Chances are that there is already a class or an HTML tag doing exactly
what you’re looking for.

On top of that, Odoo relies on
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)
(BS), one of the most complete CSS frameworks available. The framework has
been customized in order to match Odoo’s design (both community and enterprise
versions), meaning that you can use any BS class directly in Odoo and achieve
a visual result that is consistent with our UI.

Avertissement

  * The fact that a class achieves the desired visual result doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s the right one for the job. Be aware of classes triggering JS behaviors, for example.

  * Be careful about class semantics. Applying a **button class** to a **title** is not only semantically wrong, it may also lead to migration issues and visual inconsistencies.

The following sections describe tips to strip-down SCSS lines **when custom-
code is the only way to go**.

## Browser defaults

By default, each browser renders content using a _user agent stylesheet_. To
overcome inconsistencies between browsers, some of these rules are overridden
by [Bootstrap Reboot](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/content/reboot/).

At this stage all « browser-specific-decoration » rules have been stripped
away, but a big chunk of rules defining basic layout information is maintained
(or reinforced by _Reboot_ for consistency reasons).

You can rely on these rules.

Example

Applying `display: block;` to a `<div/>` is normally not necessary.

    
    
    div.element {
       display: block;
       /* not needed 99% of the time */
    }
    

Example

In this instance, you may opt to switching the HTML tag rather than adding a
new CSS rule.

    
    
    span.element {
       display: block;
       /* replace <span> with <div> instead
          to get 'display: block' by default */
    }
    

Here’s a non-comprehensive list of default rules:

Tag / Attribute | Defaults  
---|---  
`<div/>`, `<section/>`, `<header/>`, `<footer/>`… | `display: block`  
`<span/>`, `<a/>`, `<em/>`, `<b/>`… | `display: inline`  
`<button/>`, `<label/>`, `<output/>`… | `display: inline-block`  
`<img/>`, `<svg/>` | `vertical-align: middle`  
`<summary/>`, `[role="button"]` | `cursor: pointer;`  
`<q/>` |  `:before {content: open-quote}` `:after {content: close-quote}`  
… | …

## HTML tags

It may seem obvious, but the simplest and most **consistent** way of making
text look like a title is to use a header tag (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, …). Besides
reboot rules, mostly all tags carry decorative styles defined by Odoo.

Example

Don’t

XMLSCSS

    
    
    <span class="o_module_custom_title">
       Hello There!
    </span>
    
    <span class="o_module_custom_subtitle">
       I'm a subtitle.
    </span>
    
    
    
    .o_module_custom_title {
       display: block;
       font-size: 120%;
       font-weight: bold;
       animation: 1s linear 1s mycustomAnimation;
    }
    
    .o_module_custom_subtitle {
       display: block;
       font-size: 12px;
       font-weight: bold;
       animation: 2s linear 1s mycustomAnimation;
    }
    

Do

XMLSCSS

    
    
    <h5 class="o_module_custom_title">
       Hello There!
    </h5>
    
    <div class="o_module_custom_subtitle">
       <b><small>I'm a subtitle.</small></b>
    </div>
    
    
    
    .o_module_custom_title {
       animation: 1s linear 1s mycustomAnimation;
    }
    
    .o_module_custom_subtitle {
       animation: 2s linear 1s mycustomAnimation;
    }
    

Note

Besides reducing the amount of code, a modular-design approach (use classes,
tags, mixins…) keeps the visual result consistent and easily **maintainable**.

Following the last example, if Odoo titles” design changes, these changes will
be applied in the `o_module_custom_title` element too since it’s using an
`<h5>` tag.

## Utility classes

Our framework defines a multitude of utility classes designed to cover almost
all layout/design/interaction needs. The simple fact that a class already
exists justifies its use over custom CSS whenever possible.

Take the example of `position-relative`.

    
    
    position-relative {
       position: relative !important;
    }
    

Since a utility-class is defined, any CSS line with the declaration `position:
relative` is **potentially** redundant.

Odoo relies on the default [Bootstrap utility-
classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/background/) stack and
defines its own using [Bootstrap
API](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/).

### Handling utility-classes verbosity

The downside of utility-classes is the potential lack of readability.

Example

    
    
    <myComponent t-attf-class="d-flex border px-lg-2 card
    {{props.readonly ? 'o_myComponent_disabled' : ''}}
    card d-lg-block position-absolute {{props.active ?
    'o_myComponent_active' : ''}}  myComponent px-3"/>
    

To overcome the issue you may combine different approaches:

  * in Qweb attributes, only use classes to be toggled _on-the-fly_ ;

  * use new lines for each attribute;

  * order classes using the convention `[odoo component] [bootstrap component] [css declaration order]`.

Example

    
    
    <myComponent
       t-att-class="{
          o_myComponent_disabled: props.readonly,
          o_myComponent_active: props.active
       }"
       class="myComponent card position-absolute d-flex d-lg-block border px-3 px-lg-2"
    />
