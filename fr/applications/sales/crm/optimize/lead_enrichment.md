# Lead enrichment

_Lead enrichment_ is a service that provides business information for a
contact attached to a lead. Lead enrichment is an In-App Purchase (IAP) that
requires credits to use, and is available for existing leads in an Konvergo ERP
database.

The information provided by lead enrichment can include general information
about the business (including full business name and logo), social media
accounts, **Company type** , **Founded** information, **Sectors** information,
the number of **Employees** , **Estimated revenue** , **Phone** number,
**Timezone** , and **Technologies Used**.

## Enrich leads

Enrichment of leads is based on the domain of the email address of the
customer set on the lead. There are two different ways that a lead can be
enriched: _automatically_ or _manually_.

### Automatically enrich leads

During set up, if **Enrich all leads automatically** was selected on the _CRM_
**Settings** page, then no action needs to be taken by the user to enrich the
lead. A scheduled action runs automatically, every sixty minutes, and
enrichment occurs on leads, after a remote database is contacted.

section ‣ Scheduled Actions. In the <b>Search…</b> bar, type in <code>CRM</code>. Click into the
result labeled <b>CRM: enrich leads (IAP)</b>, and make any necessary adjustments. In the
<b>Execute Every</b> field, enter a value greater than, or equal to, five minutes.</p>

</div>

### Manually enrich leads

If the **Enrich leads on demand only** option was selected on the _CRM_
**Settings** page, when activating **Lead Enrichment** , each lead that a user
wishes to enrich **must** be manually enriched. This is achieved by clicking
the **Enrich** button in the top menu of the lead.

The same information will be retrieved at the same IAP credit cost (one per
enrichment). This method of enrichment is useful when every lead does not need
to be enriched, or cost is an issue.

Astuce</p><p>Manually enrich leads in bulk using the <em>list</em> view. First, navigate to CRM app
‣ Leads, and click the list view button (<b>☰ (three horizontal lines)</b> icon). Next,
tick the checkboxes for the leads that should be manually enriched. Finally, click the
<b>⚙️ Action</b> icon, and select <b>Enrich</b> from the resulting drop-down menu. This
can also be achieved from the <em>My Pipeline</em> page. To do so, simply open the <em>CRM</em> app, or
navigate to CRM app ‣ Sales ‣ My Pipeline. Either route reveals leads and
opportunities on the <b>Pipeline</b> page.</p>

## Tarification
