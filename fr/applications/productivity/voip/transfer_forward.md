# Make, receive, transfer, and forward calls

Calling prospective clients, customers, or colleagues is an essential part of
any business. A company also needs to be available when customers call, in
order to build trust and make connections.

This document covers how to make, receive, transfer, and forward calls with
Odoo _VoIP_.

## Make calls

Starting on the Odoo dashboard, a call can be made by opening the phone widget
in the the upper-right corner, which is represented by a ☎️ (phone) icon.

Then, a user can click on the Contacts tab, and click into any contact in the
database to make a call.

Additionally, one can also use the Search bar in the VOIP pop-up window to
find any desired contact.

To manually make a call, click the ⌨️ (keyboard) icon, and proceed to manually
key in the desired number. Do not forget to lead with the \+ (plus) icon,
followed by the international country code.

Example

For the United States of America, the country code and \+ (plus) icon, would
look like this: `+1`. If one were to dial Belgium, the number would be
prefixed by `+32`, and for Great Britain it would be `+44`.

After entering the full number, with the required \+ (plus) icon prefix and
country code, click the green 📞 (phone) icon to start the call. When finished,
click the red 📞 (phone) icon to end the call.

## Receive calls

An incoming call automatically opens the _VoIP_ widget, when a user is using
the Odoo database. Should the database be open in another tab, a sound plays
(the sound **must** be activated on the device).

Once back to the tab, the calling screen of the _VoIP_ phone widget appears.

Click the green 📞 (phone) icon to pick up the call, or the red 📞 (phone) icon
to reject the call.

## Ajouter à la file d’attente

All the contacts and customers that need to be called can be seen in one place
with the Odoo _VoIP_ phone widget, under the Next activities tab.

To add a call to the Next activities tab, click the green 📞 (phone) icon,
while in kanban view of the _CRM_ application.

To remove them from the call queue, hover over the opportunity that has a call
scheduled, and click the red 📞 (phone) icon that appears with the \- (minus)
icon.

When navigating back to the _VoIP_ phone widget, **only** the calls that are
scheduled immediately for that day appear in the queue under the Next
Activities tab of the _VoIP_ pop-up widget.

widget.](../../../_images/add-call-queue.png)

The Next Activities tab of the _VoIP_ phone widget is integrated with the
following Odoo apps: _CRM_ , _Project_ , and _Helpdesk_.

A call can be added in the chatter of records within those applications.

To manually add a call, via the chatter, click Activities (next to the 🕗
(clock) icon). Under Activity Type, select Call from the drop-down menu that
appears.

Next, set a Due Date, and add a Summary.

Lastly, change the Assigned to field to the person that should make the call.
Whomever is set in this last field (Assigned to) has this call show up in
their Next Activities call queue in the Odoo _VoIP_ phone widget.

Important

Only calls for the immediate day (today’s date) appear in the Next Activities
tab of the _VoIP_ phone widget for that specific user.

If specified, click Save or Open Calendar to complete the scheduling of the
call.

## Transfer calls

A call can be transferred from one user to another in the Odoo _VoIP_ phone
widget. However, this can **only** occur after speaking to the caller first.
Without picking up the call in the Odoo _VoIP_ phone widget, the only way to
transfer a call is automatically though the provider console/portal.
