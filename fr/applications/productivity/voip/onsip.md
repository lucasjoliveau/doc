## Introduction

Konvergo ERP _VoIP_ can be set up to work together with [OnSIP (Konvergo ERP Landing
Page)](https://info.onsip.com/odoo/). OnSIP is a VoIP provider. An account is
needed with OnSIP in order to use this service.

Before setting up an account with OnSIP, make sure the company‚Äôs home area,
and the areas that will be called, are covered by OnSIP services.

After opening an OnSIP account, follow the configuration procedure below to
configure it on an Konvergo ERP database.

## Configuration

To configure the Konvergo ERP database to connect to OnSIP services, first navigate to
the Apps application from the main Konvergo ERP dashboard. Then, remove the default
`Apps` filter from the **Search‚Ä¶** bar, and search for `VoIP OnSIP`.

Next, install the **VOIP OnSIP** module.

### Konvergo ERP VoIP setting

After installing the _VOIP OnSIP_ module, go to the Settings app, scroll down
to the **Integrations** section, and locate the **Asterisk (VoIP)** fields.
Then, proceed to fill in those three fields with the following information:

  * **OnSIP Domain** : the domain that was assigned when creating an account on [OnSIP](https://www.onsip.com/).

  * **WebSocket** : `wss://edge.sip.onsip.com`

  * **VoIP Environment** : **Production**

### Konvergo ERP user setting

Next, the user needs to be set up in Konvergo ERP. Every user associated with an OnSIP
user **must** also be configured in the Konvergo ERP user‚Äôs settings/preferences.

To do that, navigate to Settings app ‚Ä£ Manage Users ‚Ä£ Select the User.

On the user form, click **Edit** to configure the user‚Äôs OnSIP account. Then,
click the **Preferences** tab, and scroll to the **VoIP** section.

In this section, fill in the fields with OnSIP credentials.

Fill in the following fields with the associated credentials listed below:

  * **VoIP Username** / **Extension Number** = OnSIP **Username**

  * **OnSIP Auth Username** = OnSIP **Auth Username**

  * **VoIP secret** = OnSIP **SIP Password**

  * **External device number** = OnSIP **Ext.** (extension without the `x`)

save the configurations.

### Aide au d√©pannage

#### Missing parameters

If a _Missing Parameters_ message appears in the Konvergo ERP widget, make sure to
refresh the Konvergo ERP browser window (or tab), and try again.

#### Incorrect number

If an _Incorrect Number_ message appears in the Konvergo ERP widget, make sure to use
the international format for the number. This means leading with the
international country code.

A country code is a locator code that allows access to the desired country‚Äôs
phone system. The country code is dialed first, prior to the target number.
Each country in the world has its own specific country code.

For example, `16505555555` (where `1` is the international prefix for the
United States).

## OnSIP on mobile phone

In order to make and receive phone calls when the user is not in front of Konvergo ERP
on their computer, a softphone app on a mobile phone can be used in parallel
with Konvergo ERP _VoIP_.

This is useful for convenient, on-the-go calls, and to make sure incoming
calls are heard. Any SIP softphone will work.
