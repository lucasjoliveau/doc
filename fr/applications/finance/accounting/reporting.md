### Résumé général

The **Executive Summary** allows a quick look at all the important figures to
run your company.

In basic terms, this is what each item in the following section reports:

  * **Performance :**
    
    * **Marge bénéficiaire brute :**
    

The contribution of all sales made by your business **minus** any direct costs
needed to make those sales (labor, materials, etc.).

    * **Marge bénéficiaire nette :**
    

The contribution of all sales made by your business **minus** any direct costs
needed to make those sales _and_ fixed overheads your company has
(electricity, rent, taxes to be paid as a result of those sales, etc.).

    * **Return on investment (per annum):**
    

The ratio of net profit made to the amount of assets the company used to make
those profits.

  * **Position :**
    
    * **Average debtors days:**
    

The average number of days it takes your customers to (fully) pay you across
all your customer invoices.

    * **Average creditors days:**
    

The average number of days it takes you to (fully) pay your suppliers across
all your bills.

    * **Short-term cash forecast:**
    

How much cash is expected in or out of your business in the next month, i.e.,
the balance of your **Sales account** for the month **minus** the balance of
your **Purchases account** for the month.

    * **Ratio actif circulant/passif circulant :**
    

Also referred to as **current ratio** , this is the ratio of current assets
(assets that could be turned into cash within a year) to the current
liabilities (liabilities that will be due in the next year). It is typically
used to measure a company’s ability to service its debt.

### Grand livre

The **General Ledger Report** shows all transactions from all accounts for a
chosen date range. The initial summary report shows each account’s totals;
from here, you can view a detailed transaction report or any exceptions. This
report helps check every transaction that occurred during a specific period.
