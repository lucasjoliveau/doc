# Modèles de lettrage

Reconciliation models are used to automate the [bank
reconciliation](reconciliation) process, which is especially handy when
dealing with recurring entries like bank fees. Reconciliation models can also
be helpful in handling [cash
discounts](../customer_invoices/cash_discounts).

Each model is created based on a model type and **bank transaction
conditions**.

## Reconciliation model types

The reconciliation models are available by going to Accounting ‣ Configuration
‣ Banks: Reconciliation Models. For each reconciliation model, a **Type** must
be set. Three types of models exist:

  * **Button to generate counterpart entry** : a button is created in the resulting entry section of the bank reconciliation view. If clicked, this button generates a counterpart entry to reconcile with the active transaction based on the rules set in the model. The rules specified in the model determine the counterpart entry’s account(s), amount(s), label(s), and analytic distribution;

  * **Rule to suggest counterpart entry** : used for recurring transactions to match the transaction to a new entry based on conditions that must match the information on the transaction;

  * **Rule to match invoices/bills** : used for recurring transactions to match the transaction to existing invoices, bills, or payments based on conditions that must match the information on the transaction.

## Default reconciliation models

In Konvergo ERP, different models are available by default depending on the company’s
fiscal localization. These can be updated if needed. Users can also create
their own reconciliation models by clicking **New**.

### Invoices/Bills perfect match

This model should be at the top of the _sequence_ of models, as it enables
Konvergo ERP to suggest matching existing invoices or bills with a bank transaction
based on set conditions.

bills-perfect-match.png)

Konvergo ERP automatically reconciles the payment when the **Auto-validate** option is
selected, and the model conditions are perfectly met. In this case, it expects
to find on the bank statement’s line the invoice/payment’s reference (as
**Label** is selected) and the partner’s name (as **Partner is set** is
selected) to suggest the correct counterpart entry and reconcile the payment
automatically.

### Invoices/Bills partial match if underpaid

This model suggests a customer invoice or vendor bill that partially matches
the payment when the amount received is slightly lower than the invoice
amount, for example in the case of **cash discounts**. The difference is
reconciled with the account indicated in the **counterpart entries** tab.

The reconciliation model **Type** is **Rule to match invoices/bills** , and
the **Payment tolerance** should be set.

### Line with bank fees

This model suggests a counterpart entry according to the rules set in the
model. In this case, the reconciliation model **Type** is **Rule to suggest
counterpart entry** , and the **Label** can be used for example, to identify
the information referring to the **Bank fees** in the label of the
transaction.

Note</p><p><a href="https://regexone.com/">Regular expressions</a>, often abbreviated as <b>Regex</b>, can be used in
Konvergo ERP in various ways to search, validate, and manipulate data within the system. Regex can be
powerful but also complex, so it’s essential to use it judiciously and with a good understanding
of the patterns you’re working with.</p>
<p>To use regular expressions in your reconciliation models, set the <b>Transaction Type</b>
to <b>Match Regex</b> and add your expression. Konvergo ERP automatically retrieves the
transactions that match your Regex expression and the conditions specified in your model.</p>

## Partner mapping

Partner mapping allows you to establish rules for automatically matching
transactions to the correct partner account, saving time and reducing the risk
of errors that can occur during manual reconciliation. For example, you can
create a partner mapping rule for incoming payments with specific reference
numbers or keywords in the transaction description. When an incoming payment
meets these criteria, Konvergo ERP automatically maps it to the corresponding
customer’s account.

To create a partner mapping rule, go to the **Partner Mapping** tab and enter
the **Find Text in Label** , **Find Text in Notes** , and **Partner**.
