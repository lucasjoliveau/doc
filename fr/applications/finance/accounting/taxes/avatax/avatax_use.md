# AvaTax use

AvaTax is a tax calculation software that can be integrated with Konvergo ERP in the
United States and Canada. Once the [integration setup](../avatax) is
complete, the calculated tax is simple and automatic.

## Calcul des taxes

Automatically calculate taxes on Konvergo ERP quotations and invoices with AvaTax by
confirming the documents during the sales flow. Alternatively, calculate the
taxes manually by clicking the **Compute taxes using Avatax** button while
these documents are in draft mode.

</div> ![Sales quotation with the confirm and compute taxes using

The tax calculation is triggered during the following automatic trigger and
manual trigger circumstances.

### Automatic triggers

  * When the sales rep sends the quote by email with **Send by email** button (pop-up).

  * When the customer views the online quote on the portal.

  * When a quote is confirmed and becomes a sales order.

  * When the customer views the invoice on the portal.

  * When a draft invoice is validated.

  * When the customer views the subscription in the portal.

  * When a subscription generates an invoice.

  * When the customer gets to the last screen of the eCommerce checkout.

### Manual triggers

  * **Compute taxes using Avatax** button at the bottom of the quote.

  * **Compute taxes using Avatax** button at the top of the invoice.

## AvaTax synchronization

Synchronization occurs with AvaTax, when the _invoice_ is created in Konvergo ERP.
This means the sales tax is recorded with Avalara (AvaTax software developer).

To do so, navigate to Sales app ‣ Orders ‣ Quotations. Select a quotation from
the list.

After confirming a quotation and validating the delivery, click **Create
Invoice**. Indicate whether it is a **Regular invoice** , **Down payment
(percentage)** , or **Down payment (fixed amount)**.

Then click **Create and view invoice**. The recorded taxes can be seen in the
**Journal Items** tab of the invoice. There will be different taxes depending
on the location of the **Delivery Address**.

Finally, press the **Confirm** button to complete the invoice and synchronize
with the AvaTax portal.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Avertissement</p><p>An invoice cannot be <b>Reset to draft</b> because this causes de-synchronization with the
AvaTax Portal. Instead, click <b>Add credit note</b> and state: <code>Sync with AvaTax Portal</code>.
See this documentation: <a href="../../customer_invoices/credit_notes">Avoirs et remboursements</a>.</p>
</div>

## Fixed price discounts

Add a fixed price discount to a valuable customer by click **Add a line** on
the customer’s invoice. Add the product discount and set the **Price** to
either a positive or negative value. To recalculate the taxes, click **Compute
taxes using Avatax**.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">

</div>

## Journalisation

It is possible to log Avalara/_AvaTax_ actions in Konvergo ERP for further analysis,
or verification of functionality. Logging is accessible through the _AvaTax_
settings.

To start logging _AvaTax_ actions, first, navigate to the Accounting app ‣
Configuration ‣ Settings.

Then, in the **Taxes** section, under the **AvaTax** settings, click **Start
logging for 30 minutes**.

Upon starting the log process, Konvergo ERP will log all Avalara/_AvaTax_ actions
performed in the database.

To view the logs, click on **Show logs** to the right of the **Start logging
for 30 minutes**. This reveals a detailed list of Avalara/_AvaTax_ actions.
This list is sortable by the following columns:

  * **Created on** : timestamp of the _AvaTax_ calculation.

  * **Created by** : numeric value of the user in the database.

  * **Database name** : name of the database.

  * **Type** : two values can be chosen for this field, **Server** or **Client**.

  * **Name** : Avalara service name. In this case, it will be _AvaTax_.

  * **Level** : by default, this will be `INFO`.

  * **Path** : indicates the path taken to make the calculation.

  * **Line** : indicates the line the calculation is made on.

  * **Function** : indicates the calculation taken on the line.

![Avalara logging page with top row of list
highlighted.](../../../../../_images/logging.png)

Click into the log line to reveal another field, called **Message**.

This field populates a raw transcription of the transaction, which involves
the creation (or adjustment) of a sales invoice using the Avalara _AvaTax_
API.

The transaction includes details, such as addresses for shipping from and to,
line items describing the products or services, tax codes, tax amounts, and
other relevant information.

The **Message** contains the calculated taxes for different jurisdictions and
confirms the creation (or adjustment) of the transaction.
