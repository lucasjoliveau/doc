This document outlines all of the configurations and settings for the _Fleet_
application, including settings, manufacturers, vehicle models, and model
categories.

## Paramètres

To access the settings menu, go to Fleet application ‣ Configuration ‣
Settings. There are only two settings that need configuration, the vehicle
contract end date alert delay, and a new vehicle request limit.

![Settings available for the Fleet application.](../../_images/fleet-
settings.png)

### Alerte sur la date de fin du contrat

The End Date Contract Alert field defines an alert delay for the persons
responsible for vehicle contracts. The responsible person(s) will receive an
email informing them a vehicle contract is about to expire in the number of
days defined in this field.

Note

To determine who the responsible person is for a contract, open an individual
contract. The person listed as Responsible under the Contract Information
section of the contract is the person who will receive the alert.

To access all contracts, navigate to Fleet app ‣ Fleet ‣ Contracts and all
contracts appear in the list. Click on a Contract to view it.

An individual contract can also be found by navigating to Fleet app ‣ Fleet ‣
Fleet and clicking on an individual vehicle. On the vehicle form, click the
Contracts smart button at the top of the page. The contract(s) associated with
this vehicle only appears in the list. Click on an individual contract to open
it. The Responsible person is listed on the contract.

### New Vehicle Request

The New Vehicle Request field sets a limit on how many new vehicles are
requested based on fleet availability. An employee filling out the salary
configurator form (after being offered a position), will _not_ be able to
request a new car if the number of existing cars is greater than the number
specified in the New Vehicle Request field. Enter the specific number limit
for existing available cars in this field.

Example

If the New Vehicle Request limit is set to 20 vehicles, and there are 25
vehicles available, an employee would not be able to request a new vehicle. If
there are only 10 cars available, then the employee would be able to request a
new vehicle.

## Fabricants

Odoo _Fleet_ comes pre-configured with sixty-six commonly used car and bicycle
manufacturers in the database, along with their logos. To view the pre-loaded
manufacturers, go to Fleet app ‣ Configuration ‣ Manufacturers.

The manufacturers appear in a list view in alphabetical order. Each
manufacturer’s card lists how many specific models are configured for each
particular manufacturer. Odoo comes with forty six pre-configured models from
four major auto manufacturers and one major bicycle manufacturer: Audi, BMW,
Mercedes, Opel (cars), and Eddy Merckx (bicycle).

listed.](../../_images/manufacturer.png)

### Add a manufacturer

To add a new manufacturer to the database, click Create. A manufacturer form
will load. Only two pieces of information are needed, the Name of the
manufacturer, and the logo. Type the name of the manufacturer in the name
field, and select an image to upload for the logo. When the information is
entered, click Save.

## Modèles de véhicules

Many manufacturers have a variety of models that they produce. When adding a
vehicle to the fleet, it is important to specify the vehicle model being
added. Odoo comes with pre-configured car models from four major auto
manufacturers, and one pre-configured bicycle model from one bicycle
manufacturer: Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Opel (cars), and Eddy Merckx (bicycle). If
a vehicle _other_ than the pre-configured models from these manufacturers are
part of a fleet, the model (and/or manufacturer) needs to be added to the
database.

database:

### Add a new model

New vehicle models can easily be added to the database. To add a new model,
navigate to Fleet app ‣ Configuration ‣ Vehicle Models. Click Create and a
vehicle model form will load. Enter the following information on the form,
then click Save. Be advised, some fields are specific to Belgian based
companies, so not all fields or sections may be visible depending on the
location of the company.

  * Model name: enter the model name in the field.

  * Manufacturer: select the manufacturer from the drop-down menu. If the manufacturer is not configured, type in the manufacturer and then click Create or Create & Edit.

  * Vehicle Type: select one of two preconfigured vehicle types, either Car or Bike, from the drop-down menu. The vehicle types are hardcoded in Odoo and are integrated with the _Payroll_ application since vehicles can be part of an employee’s benefits. Adding additional vehicle types is not possible as it will affect payroll.

  * Category: select the category the vehicle is categorized under from the drop-down menu. To create a new category, type in the category and then click Create (new category).

Note

When the manufacturer is selected, the logo for the manufacturer will
automatically load in the image box in the top right corner.

#### Information tab

  * Doors Number: enter the number of doors the vehicle has.

  * Color: enter the color of the vehicle.

  * Model Year: enter the year the vehicle was manufactured.

  * Trailer Hitch: check this box if the vehicle has a trailer hitch installed.

##### Salaire

Note

The Salary section only appears for Belgian-based companies, and only if the
company has their localization setting set to Belgium. The cost values are all
**monthly** with the exception of the Catalog Value (VAT Incl.).

  * Can be requested: check this box if employees can request this model vehicle.

  * Catalog Value (VAT Incl.): enter the MSRP for the vehicle at the time of purchase or lease.

  * C02 fee: this value is automatically calculated based on Belgian laws and regulations, and cannot be modified. The value is based on the value entered in the CO2 Emissions field in the Engine section of the vehicle form.

Important

Modifying the CO2 Emissions field will adjust the value in the CO2 fee field.

  * Cost (Depreciated): enter the monthly cost for the vehicle, which appears in the salary configurator that is available to a future employee when they are offered a job position. This value impacts the gross and net salary of the employee who is assigned to the vehicle. This figure is depreciated over time according to local tax laws. The Cost (Depreciated) does not depreciate automatically on the _vehicle model_ , it only depreciates based on the _contract_ linked to a specific vehicle and not on the general model.

  * Total Cost (Depreciated): this value is the Cost (Depreciated) and the C02 fee fields combined, and also is depreciated over time.

##### Moteur

  * CO2 Standard: enter the standard amount of carbon dioxide in grams per kilometer (g/km) for a similar sized vehicle.

  * Tax Deduction: this field auto-populates according to the engine specifications, and cannot be modified. The percentage is based on the localization settings and local tax laws.

#### Vendors tab

Vehicle specific vendors, such as car dealerships, are not listed separately
from other vendors. The vendors that a vehicle can be purchased from also
appear in the list of vendors used by the _Purchase_ app.

The vendor(s) the vehicle can be purchased from may be added in this tab. To
add a vendor, click Add, and a pop-up loads with a list of all the vendors
currently in the database. Select the vendor to add by clicking the checkbox
next to the vendor name, then click Select. There is no limit to the number of
vendors that can be added to this list.

If a vendor is not in the database, add a vendor by clicking Create. A vendor
form will load. Enter the information in the vendor tab, then click Save &
Close to add the vendor and close the window, or Save & New to add the current
vendor and create another new vendor.

## Catégorie de modèle

To best organize a fleet, it is recommended to have vehicle models housed
under a specific category, to more easily see what kinds of vehicles are in
the fleet. Model categories are set on the vehicle model form.

To view all the models currently set up, navigate to Fleet application ‣
Configuration ‣ Model Category. All models are displayed in a list view.

### Add a new model category

To add a new category, click Create. A new entry line appears at the bottom of
the list. Type in the new category, then click Save to save the entry.

To reorganize how the categories appear in the list, click on the up and down
arrows to the left of the category to be moved, and drag the line to the
desired position. The order of the list does not affect the database in any
way. However, it may be preferable to view the vehicle categories in a
specific order, for example, by size, or the numbers of passengers the vehicle
can carry.
