# Cr√©er un nouvel employ√©

When a new employee is hired, the first step is to create a new employee
record. Starting in the Employees app dashboard, click the New button and a
new employee form appears. Fill out the required information and any
additional details.

![Create a new employee form with all fields filled
out.](../../../_images/new-employee-form.png)

Note

Le num√©ro de t√©l√©phone et le nom de l‚Äôentreprise actuelle sont indiqu√©s dans
les champs T√©l√©phone professionnel et Soci√©t√©.

## Informations g√©n√©rales

The employee form automatically saves as data is entered, but the save
manually icon (a could with an up arrow inside it) may be clicked at any time
to manually save the form.

### Champs obligatoires

  * Nom : Saisissez le nom de l‚Äôemploy√©.

  * Soci√©t√© : S√©lectionnez la soci√©t√© dans le menu d√©roulant qui a engag√© le nouvel employ√© ou cr√©ez une nouvelle soci√©t√© en saisissant le nom dans le champ.

![A new employee form with the required fields
highlighted.](../../../_images/employee-new.png)

### Champs optionnels

  * Photo: In the top right image box of the employee form, click on the ‚úèÔ∏è (pencil) edit icon to select a photo to upload.

  * Job Position: Enter the employee‚Äôs job position title under their name, or select the job position from the Job Position drop-down menu to have this field auto-populate. The Job Position field under the employee name can be modified and does not need to match the selection made in the Job Position drop-down.

Example

It is recommended to have the job positions match, but if desired, the typed-
in description in this field can contain more information than the selected
drop-down job position.

An example where this may be applicable is if someone is hired for a sales
representative position configured as Sales Representative in the
_Recruitment_ app, and that is selected for the drop-down Job Position field.

In the typed in job position field beneath the employee‚Äôs name, the position
could be more specific, such as `Sales Representative - Subscriptions` if the
employee is focused solely on subscription sales.

![Both job position fields entered but with different
information.](../../../_images/job-description-fields.png)

  * Tags: Click on a tag in the drop-down menu to add any tags applicable to the employee. Any tag can be created in this field by typing it in. Once created, the new tag is available for all employee records. There is no limit to the amount of tags that can be added.

  * Work Contact Information: Enter the employee‚Äôs Work Mobile, Work Phone, Work Email, and/or Company name.

  * D√©partement : S√©lectionnez le d√©partement de l‚Äôemploy√© dans le menu d√©roulant.

  * Job Position: Select the employee‚Äôs job position from the drop-down menu. Once a selection is made, the Job Position field beneath the employee‚Äôs name automatically updates to reflect the currently selected job position. These positions are from the [Recruitment](../recruitment/new_job.html) application, and reflect the currently configured job positions.

  * Manager : S√©lectionnez le manager de l‚Äôemploy√© dans le menu d√©roulant.

  * Mentor : S√©lectionnez le mentor de l‚Äôemploy√© dans le menu d√©roulant.

  * Next Appraisal Date: This date automatically populates with a date that is computed according to the settings configured in the _Appraisals_ application. This date can be modified using the calendar selector.

Note

Apr√®s avoir s√©lectionn√© un Manager, si le champ Mentor est laiss√© vide, le
manager s√©lectionn√© est automatiquement compl√©t√© dans le champ Mentor.

Astuce

To make edits to the selected Department, Manager, Coach, or Company, click
the Internal Link arrow next to the respective selection. The Internal Link
arrow opens the selected form, allowing for modifications. Click Save after
any edits are made.
