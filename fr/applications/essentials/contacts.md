# Contacts

The _Contacts_ application comes installed on all Konvergo ERP databases. Contacts are
created for customers the company does business with through Konvergo ERP. A contact
is a repository of vital business information, facilitating communication and
business transactions.

## Contact form

To create a new contact, navigate to the Contacts app, and click **Create**. A
new form appears where various contact information can be added.

### Contact type

Konvergo ERP allows for both **Individual** and **Company** contacts. Select either
**Individual** or **Company** , depending on the type of contact that is being
added.

### Name

First, fill in the name of the **Individual** or **Company**. This is how the
name appears throughout the database. This field is **mandatory**.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Astuce</p><p><b>Individual</b> contacts can have a <b>Company</b> contact linked to it. After
selecting <b>Individual</b>, a new <b>Company Name…</b> field appears below the
first name field.</p>
</div>

### Address

Next, enter the **Address** of the **Company** or **Individual**.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Astuce</p><p>If the <b>Individual</b> option is chosen, then the <em>type of address</em> can be chosen from a
drop-down menu. Options for this drop-down menu include: <b>Contact</b>, <b>Invoice
Address</b>, <b>Delivery Address</b>, <b>Other Address</b>, and <b>Private
Address</b>.</p>
</div>

### Additional fields

Additional details are included on the initial form. The following fields are
available:

  * **VAT** : Value Added Tax number.

  * **Citizen Identification** : citizen or government identification number (only available on **Individual**).

  * **Job Position** : list the job position of the **Individual** (only available on **Individual**).

  * **Phone** : list phone number (with country code). Make a call, send an SMS, or WhatsApp message by hovering over the field on the saved form, and clicking the desired option.

  * **Tags** : enter preconfigured tags by typing them in the field, or clicking the drop-down menu, and selecting one. To create a new one, type the new tag in the field, and click **Create** from the resulting drop-down menu.

### Contacts & Addresses tab

At the bottom of the contact form are several tabs. On the **Contacts &
Addresses** tab, contacts can be added that are associated with a **Company**
and related addresses. For example, a specific contact person for the company
can be listed here.

Multiple addresses can be added on both **Individual** and **Company**
contacts. To do so, click **Add** in the **Contacts & Addresses** tab. Doing
so reveals a **Create Contact** pop-up form, in which additional addresses can
be configured.

Once an option is selected, enter the corresponding contact information that
should be used for the specified address type.

Add the **Contact Name** , **Address** , **Email** , along with the **Phone**

_Purchase_ , **or** _Point of Sale_ applications are installed.

The **Fiscal Position** can be set on the **Sales & Purchases** tab. Select a
**Fiscal Position** from the drop-down menu.

#### Sales section

Under the **Sales** heading, a specific **Salesperson** can be assigned to a
contact. To do that, click the **Salesperson** drop-down field, and select
one. Create a new **Salesperson** by typing the user’s name, and making the
appropriate selection.

Certain **Payment Terms** , or a certain **Pricelist** , can also be set, if

one company in a multi-company database, select it from the **Company** field
drop-down list. Use the **Website** drop-down menu to restrict the publishing
of this contact to one website (if working on a database with multiple
websites). Select one or more **Website Tags** to assist in filtering
published customers on the `/customers` website page. Select an **Industry**

The **Accounting** tab appears when the _Accounting_ application is installed.
Here, a user can add any related **Bank Accounts** , or set default
**Accounting entries**.

can be left on this contact form, just like on the contact form noted above.

Next is the **Partner Assignment** tab, which by default, includes a
**Geolocation** section, and other partner options, including **Partner
Activation** and **Partner Review** configurations. These are **only** present
when the _Enterprise Resellers_ module is installed.

### Membership tab

Finally, there is the **Membership** tab, which can help users manage any
memberships that are being offered to this specific contact. It should be
noted that this tab only appears when the _Members_ applications is installed.

## Smart buttons

At the top of the contact form, there are some additional options available,
known as _smart buttons_.

Here, Konvergo ERP displays a variety of records, related to this contact, that were
created on other apps. Konvergo ERP integrates information from every single app, so
there are many smart buttons.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>For example, there is an <b>Opportunities</b> smart button, where all the opportunities
related to this customer from the <em>CRM</em> app are accessible.</p>
</div> <div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
Astuce</p><p>If the corresponding applications are installed, their related smart buttons appear
automatically on a contact form.</p>
</div>

A user can see any **Meetings** , **Sales** , **POS Orders** ,
**Subscriptions** , project **Tasks** , and the **More** smart button reveals
additional options, via a drop-down menu. A user can even quickly access
**Purchases** , **Helpdesk** tasks, **On-time Rate** for deliveries,
**Invoiced** information, **Vendor Bills** , and the **Partner Ledger**
connected to this contact.

Deliveries, documents, loyalty cards, and direct debits are _also_ linked to
smart buttons, like this, should there be any outstanding/on-file for this
contact.

If the contact is a partner, the user can visit their partner page on the
Konvergo ERP-built website by clicking the **Go to Website** smart button.

### Archive contacts

If a user decides they no longer want to have this contact active, the record
can be archived. To do that, go to the __**Action** menu at the top of the
contact form, and click **Archive**.

Then, click **OK** from the resulting **Confirmation** pop-up window.

With this contact successfully archived, as indicated by a banner at the top,
they do not show up in the main contacts page, but they can still be searched
for with the **Archived** filter.
