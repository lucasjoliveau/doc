# One-step manufacturing

Konvergo ERP _Manufacturing_ allows users to manufacture products using one, two, or
three steps. When using one-step manufacturing, Konvergo ERP creates a manufacturing
order (MO), but does not generate transfers for the movement of components out
of inventory or finished products into stock. Inventory counts still update
based on the number of components used and products manufactured, but the act
of transferring them to and from inventory is not tracked.

## Create manufacturing order

To manufacture a product in Konvergo ERP _Manufacturing_ , begin by navigating to
Manufacturing â€£ Operations â€£ Manufacturing Orders, and then click **New** to
create a new MO.

On the new MO, select the product to be produced from the **Product** drop-
down menu. The **Bill of Material** field auto-populates with the associated
bill of materials (BoM).

If a product has more than one BoM configured for it, the specific BoM can be
selected in the **Bill of Material** field, and the **Product** field auto-
populates with the associated product.

After a BoM has been selected, the **Components** and **Work Orders** tabs
auto-populate with the components and operations specified on the BoM. If
additional components or operations are required for the MO being configured,
add them to the **Components** and **Work Orders** tabs by clicking **Add a
line**.

## Process manufacturing order

An MO is processed by completing all of the work orders listed under its
**Work Orders** tab. This can be done on the MO itself, or from the work order
tablet view.

### Basic workflow

To complete work orders from the MO itself, begin by navigating to
Manufacturing â€£ Operations â€£ Manufacturing Orders, and then select an MO.

On the MO page, select the **Work Orders** tab. Once work begins on the first
work order that needs to be completed, click the **Start** button for that
work order. Konvergo ERP _Manufacturing_ then starts a timer that keeps track of how
long the work order takes to complete.

When the work order is completed, click the **Done** button for that work
order. Repeat the same process for each work order listed on the **Work
Orders** tab.

After completing all of the work orders, click **Produce All** at the top of
the screen to mark the MO as **Done** , and register the manufactured
product(s) into inventory.

### Tablet view workflow

To complete the work orders for an MO using the tablet view, begin by
navigating to Manufacturing â€£ Operations â€£ Manufacturing Orders, and then
select a manufacturing order.

Next, click on the **Work Orders** tab, and then select the **ðŸ“± (tablet)**
button on the line of the first work order to be processed. This opens the
tablet view.

fabrication.](../../../../_images/tablet-view-button1.png)

After opening the tablet view, Konvergo ERP _Manufacturing_ automatically starts a
timer that keeps track of how long the work order takes to complete. After
completing the work order, click the **Mark as Done** button in the top-right
corner of the tablet view.

Clicking **Mark as Done** while there is at least one more work order left to
complete opens a page that lists the next work order. Click on that work order
to open it in the tablet view.

Once the final work order for the MO has been reached, a **Mark as Done and
Close MO** button appears on the tablet view in addition to the **Mark as
Done** button. Click **Mark as Done and Close MO** to mark the MO as **Done**
and register the manufactured product(s) into inventory.

It is also possible to complete the final operation while keeping the MO open,
by clicking **Mark as Done**. In this case, the MO can be closed later by
clicking the **Produce All** button on the order.
