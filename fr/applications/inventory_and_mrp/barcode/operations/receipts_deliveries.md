# Process receipts and deliveries with barcodes

The _Barcode_ app can be used to process receipts, deliveries, and other types
of operations in real time using a barcode scanner or the Konvergo ERP mobile app.

This makes it possible to process operations on the warehouse floor when they
happen, instead of having to wait to validate transfers from a computer.
Processing operations this way can help to properly attribute barcodes to the
appropriate products, pickings, locations, and more.

## Enable Barcode app

To use the _Barcode_ app to process transfers, it must be installed by
enabling the feature from the settings of the _Inventory_ app.

To do so, go to the Inventory app ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings. Then, scroll
down to the **Barcode** section, and click the checkbox next to the **Barcode
Scanner** feature.

Once the checkbox is ticked, click **Save** at the top of the page to save
changes.

Once the page has refreshed, new options will be displayed under the **Barcode
Scanner** feature: **Barcode Nomenclature** (with a corresponding drop-down
menu), where either **Default Nomenclature** or **Default GS1 Nomenclature**
can be selected.

There is also a **Configure Product Barcodes** internal link arrow, and a set
of **Print** buttons for printing barcode commands and a barcode demo sheet.

For more on setting up and configuring the **Barcode** app, refer to the [Set
up your barcode scanner](../setup/hardware) and [Activate the Barcodes in
Konvergo ERP](../setup/software) documentation pages.

## Scan barcodes for receipts

To process warehouse receipts for incoming products, there first needs to be a
purchase order (PO) created, and a receipt operation to process.

To create a PO, navigate to the Purchase app ‣ Create to create a new request
for quotation (RFQ).

From the blank RFQ form, click the drop-down menu next to the **Vendor** field
to add a vendor. Then, on the **Product** line under the **Products** tab,
click **Add a product** , and select the desired product(s) to add to the
quotation.

Once ready, click **Save** at the top of the form, then click **Confirm
Order** to confirm the RFQ to a PO.

To process and scan barcodes for warehouse receipts, navigate to the Barcode
app.

Once inside the **Barcode app** , a **Barcode Scanning** screen displaying
different options is presented. To process receipts, click on the
**Operations** button at the bottom of the screen. This navigates to an
Operations overview page.

![Barcode app start screen with scanner.](../../../../_images/receipts-
deliveries-barcode-scanner.png)

From this page, locate the **Receipts** card, and click the **# To Process**
button to view all outstanding receipts. Then, select the desired receipt
operation to process. This navigates to the barcode transfer screen.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p class="alert-title">
Note</p><p>If <em>only</em> using a barcode scanner or the Konvergo ERP mobile app, the barcodes for each transfer of a
corresponding operation type can be scanned to be processed easily. Once scanned, the products
that are part of an existing transfer can be scanned, and new products can be added to the
transfer, as well. Once all products have been scanned, validate the transfer to proceed with the
stock moves.</p>
</div>

From this screen, an overview of all receipts to process within that transfer
(**WH/IN/000XX**) is shown. At the bottom of the screen, there are options to
**Add Product** or **Validate** , depending on if products need to be added to
the operation, or if the whole operation should be validated at once.

![Overview of receipts in transfer to scan.](../../../../_images/receipts-
deliveries-scanner-overview.png)

To process and scan each product individually, choose a specific product line.
The **+#** button (in this case, **+10**) can be clicked to indicate receipt
of that product, or the **pencil** icon can be clicked to open a new screen to
edit that product line.

From this screen, the product that’s being received is listed. Under the
product name, the **Quantity** line can be edited. Either change the `0` in
the line to the desired quantity, or click the **/# Units** button (in this
case, **/10 Units**) to automatically fill the quantity ordered from the PO.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="alert-title">
Example</p><p>In the reception operation <code>WH/IN/00019</code>, <code>10 Units</code> of the <code>Barcode Product</code> is expected to be
received. <code>[BARCODE_PROD]</code> is the <b>Internal Reference</b> set on the product form. Scan
the barcode of the <code>Barcode Product</code> to receive one unit. Afterwards, click the
<b>pencil</b> icon to manually enter the received quantities.</p>

</div>

Additionally, the **+1** and **-1** buttons can be clicked to add or subtract
quantity of the product, and the **number keys** can be used to add quantity,
as well.

Below the **number keys** is the **location** line, which reads `WH/Stock` by
default, unless another _location_ is listed on the product itself. Click this
line to reveal a drop-down menu of additional locations to choose from.

Once ready, click **Confirm** to confirm the changes made to the product line.

Then, from the overview page with all receipts to process within that transfer
(**WH/IN/000XX**), click the **+#** button on the product line for the
products being received, and click **Validate**. The receipt has now been
processed, and the **Barcode app** can be closed out.

## Scan barcodes for delivery orders

To process warehouse deliveries for outgoing products, there first needs to be
a sales order (SO) created, and a delivery operation to process.

To create a SO, navigate to the Sales app ‣ Create to create a new quotation.

From the blank quotation form, click the drop-down menu next to the
**Customer** field to add a customer. Then, on the **Product** line under the
**Order Lines** tab, click **Add a product** , and select the desired
product(s) to add to the quotation.

Once ready, click **Save** at the top of the form, and click **Confirm Order**
to confirm the quotation to a SO.

transfer (**WH/OUT/000XX**) is shown. At the bottom of the screen, there are
options to **Add Product** or **Validate** , depending on if products need to

as well.

Below the **number keys** is the **location** line, which reads `WH/Stock` by
default, unless another location is listed on the product itself.

This is the location that the product is being pulled from for delivery. Click
this line to reveal a drop-down menu of additional locations to choose from
(if this product is stored in multiple locations in the warehouse).

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">
