# Print shipping labels

Integrate Konvergo ERP with [third-party shipping carriers](third_party_shipper)
to automatically generate shipping labels that includes prices, destination
addresses, tracking numbers, and barcodes.

## Configuration

To generate labels for a third-party shipping carrier, first [install the
third-party shipping connector](third_party_shipper). Then, configure and
activate the [delivery method](third_party_shipper#inventory-shipping-
receiving-configure-delivery-method), being sure to set the **Integration
Level** to **Get Rate and Create Shipment** to generate shipping labels.
Finally, provide the company’s [source
address](third_party_shipper#inventory-shipping-receiving-configure-
source-address) and [product weights](third_party_shipper#inventory-
shipping-receiving-configure-weight).

## Print tracking labels

Tracking labels are generated after the delivery order (DO) is validated.

When both the _Sales_ and _Inventory_ apps are installed, begin on the Sales
app, and proceed to the desired quotation to add the shipping cost, confirm
the sales order, and validate the DO.

If only the _Inventory_ app is installed, create DOs directly in the Inventory
app , add the third-party carrier in the **Carrier** field, and validate the
DO.

### Add shipping on quotation

To generate a tracking label for an order, begin by creating a quotation in
Sales app ‣ Orders ‣ Quotations, clicking **New** , and filling out the
quotation form. Then, click the **Add Shipping** button in the bottom-right
corner of the quotation.

quotation.](../../../../../_images/add-shipping-button.png)

In the resulting pop-up window, select the intended carrier from the
**Shipping Method** drop-down menu. Clicking **Get Rate** displays the
shipping cost for the customer, via the third-party carrier in the **Cost**
field.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">
Important</p><p>If clicking <b>Get Rate</b> results in an error, ensure the <a href="third_party_shipper#inventory-shipping-receiving-configure-source-address"><span class="std std-ref">warehouse’s address</span></a> and <a href="third_party_shipper#inventory-shipping-receiving-configure-weight"><span class="std std-ref">weight of products in the
order</span></a> are properly configured.</p>
</div>

Click **Add** to add the cost to the quotation, which is listed as the
[configured delivery product](delivery_method#inventory-shipping-
receiving-delivery-product). Finally, click **Confirm** on the quotation, and
click the **Delivery** smart button to access the DO.

</div>

### Validate delivery order

On a delivery order form, navigate to the **Additional Info** tab to ensure
the third-party shipping carrier has been added to the **Carrier** field.

<div class="alert alert-warning">

After the items in the order have been packed, click **Validate** to get the
shipping carrier’s tracking number, and generate the shipping label.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
