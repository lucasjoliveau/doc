# Console Google Search

Google Search Console is a free web service provided by Google that allows
website owners to monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot their site’s presence in
Google Search results. It offers valuable insights into how Google views and
interacts with your site, helping you optimize its performance.

To enable GSC, go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-
console/welcome), enter your domain or URL prefix, follow the instructions,
and copy the code from Google.

prefix](../../../../_images/verify.png)

Then, access your Odoo database, go to Website ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings, and
enable Google Search Console in the SEO section. Paste the code in the
dedicated field.

Important

To prevent Google from indexing both your custom domain name `www.example.com`
and your original Odoo database URL `www.example.odoo.com`, [map your domain
name with your Odoo website](domain_names.html#domain-name-website-map).
