Important

It is mainly Odoo employees who develop new features for the codebase and
write new content for the documentation. Be sure to discuss any idea for a new
feature or page with the Odoo team so they can give you the green light before
you begin working on it. Some features may already be in development on their
side, and only approved features can be merged.
